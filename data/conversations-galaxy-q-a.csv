[INST] hi, i met an error when i used the trinity tool in galaxy website. first, i uploaded my paired-end rna-seq clean data (12 files in total, containing 3 control samples and 3 test samples, such as control1_1.fq.gz, control1-2.fq.gz, control2_1.fq.gz, control2_2.fq.gz, which had been quality-controlled and filtered by the fastp software.) from my computer. then, i found the trinity software by typing ""trinity"" in the tools bar in the upper left corner of the galaxy website homepage and used this tool. all other options are default, except for the option of 'paired end'. in the strand reads"", i selected all the six files(x represents control1, control2, control3, test1, test2, test3). in the ""right/reverse strand reads"", i selected all the six files(x represents control1, control2, control3, test1, test2, test3). afterwards, i clicked on the tools"" button to start the analysis. however, the results turns red. one of them show that ""trinity on data 47, data 45, and others: gene to transcripts map"", an error occurred with this dataset: 格式 tabular while the other show that ""trinity on data 47, data 45, and others: assembled transcripts"", an error occurred with this dataset:格式 fasta could you help me to solve this problem? thank you in advance. [/INST] during job setup click at three blocks (versions) icon at the top right corner of the middle window and select any available version from the pull-down menu. you can use assembled transcripts and transcript to genes map from history i shared. you can copy datasets from one history to another using see histories side by side history menu) , igor

[INST] hi, i am attempting to run hisat2 on paired rnaseq data. i have run it successfully previously on the main server using the mm10 built-in reference genome, however, i am now using a local server and the built-in reference genomes have apparently not been included in the set-up. i am hoping to get some assistance on how to obtain the right reference genome file for mm10 installed, or even better how to update the local server so the same built-in reference genome will be available as in the main server? thank you, asta [/INST] hi, the mm10 reference genome/build is sourced from ucsc. you will need to index the genome on your server with data manager tools. install the genome with data managers (sourced from the toolshed (@link http://usegalaxy.org/toolshed), all are in a separate category there). install dms like any other tool using the admin functions. you will need these dms at a minimum. execute them in this order first: fasta fetcher https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository/browse_repositories_in_category?sort=nameoperation=view_or_manage_repositoryid=cdf172d633d603c2) has an option to pick ucsc as the data source. sam indexer picard indexer 2bit (twobit) indexer then get the dms that create indexes for the tools you want to use. run these after the others have above have completed for the best results. the above was copied over and slightly updated from this prior galaxy biostars qa. it has more details (worth reviewing): @link https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/p/19371/ a search here with the keyword string ""biostars data manager fetch sam picard"" will find more prior qa that covers many different use cases: @link https://galaxyproject.org/search/ more details be very careful about not running an indexing tool twice – duplicated lines will cause problems and are a hassle to correct. if you use a ""dbkey"" that is already available, you must make sure that your genome is an exact match for that content. genomes that are already indexed on one of the public galaxy servers (and associated with an existing dbkey) can be found here: @link http://datacache.galaxyproject.org/ data libraries are great for storing datasets commonly used (copies do not consume any disk space), and you could put in a fasta for a genome in one to use it with tools as a custom genome precomputed tool indexes can be used from there or a history, so do not bother to load them). custom genome help is in this faq and a related faq. if you are indexing a genome from an uploaded fasta file for some reason (not available directly from a known source), the same fasta formatting rules apply: preparing and using a custom reference genome or build (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/custom-genomes/) mismatched chromosome identifiers (and how to avoid them) (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/chrom-identifiers/) but if you are admin of a server it would be better to install the genome directly and index it for tools on the server. jobs will use fewer resources and run faster this way, plus be much less likely to fail for memory reasons. data manager tools are installed/used under the masthead, top section. the files/table content is there as well. the jobs that are run by data manager tools will be sent to your active history. it is strongly recommended to set up a distinct history for each genome, or batch of genomes, and date it in the name, to better keep track of what was done over time.

[INST] i need a tool which can change the transcript id to ensemble or entraz id? i need it for goseq analysis, i think the problem in that tool is from the ids. thanks [/INST] the mapping may not be 1-1. i would suggest using the entrez ids directly from featurecounts instead to ensure distinct geneids. then, at the end, you can convert those ids to ensembl for other purposes you may have. follow the tutorial, it will help to avoid problems like this.

[INST] i want to do augustus training, but the rat model is not available on the list. is there any other ways to do it? and when i look at the maker training set, i see that i have to use the ests and protein evidence databases. where to find those databases? i have downloaded the rat assembly dataset. is it correct that i use the rna.fna file from the rn7.2 assembly as the ests or assembled cdna and use the protein.fna from the rn7.2 assembly as the protein evidence? it seemed not working in this way, but what else i should use then? [/INST] , regarding your first question, you can generate an augustus model by using the augustus training (@link https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/augustus_training/augustus_training/3.3.3) tool. respecting the following questions, if you pretend to re-annotate the rn7.2 assembly, then it is not a good idea to use the protein.fna and rna.fna datafiles from the rn7.2 assembly because that information has already been used for performing the annotation, then it will not provide any additional information. you can get an updated est dataset from genbank https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore). i recorded a short video about how to get the sequences. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq37hp_-mc0) on the other hand, the protein sequences can be obtained from uniprot https://www.uniprot.org/). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7dl_8e4sui) let me know if you need additional information. regards.

[INST] dear all i am getting an unexpected during pear end read merger fastq error showing: an error occurred with this dataset: format fastqsanger database. however two samples are merged successfully. . regards [/INST] also, try this. reloading the data was just one guess about why the reads are not all paired. @quote the solution would be to give fastq files as input with the same amount of reads. there are a few ways to filter out any forward or reverse reads that are missing a mate. after you are done, the fastq info tool should report the same number of reads in the forward and reverse files. you will not be able to do more until that is resolved. run the data through a qa tool that sorts the output into intact pairs and singletons. example: trimmomatic. see the tool form for how to use it, and our qa tutorials for usage examples. use tools that compare the read identifiers between files, and only retain output where both files contain the base read name. you might need to convert fastq tabular, do tabular manipulations, then covert tabular → fastq at the end. see the tutorial below for the choices with examples. use tools from the seqtk tool group. these do all sorts of logical data manipulations. converting to an interleaved format then back to individual forward + reverse format can get rid of stray unpaired singleton reads. if you do not understand what these terms mean, see the first qa tutorial i linked before. you can compare data visually to the examples to learn the concepts. references: text manipulation tools: data manipulation olympics (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/tutorial.html) qa tools – some basic checks to make sure data has valid format and content are always recommend, even if you do not plan on doing any trimming. @quote these tutorials can help with understanding fastq data (format/content/variants) along with example qa steps/tools. also see domain/topic tutorials at that same site for protocol-specific qa steps.ngs data logisticsquality controlmapping

(optional) multiple input pairs ..... 3. gtf and whitelist .. 2. setting advanced parameters hi javi, thanks for sharing your history with me. 1 determining the 10x inputs ============================ 1.1 order of inputs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the first thing you need to do is to determine which of your paired reads is the cdna read, and which is the barcode read. typically barcode is read1 and cdna is read2, but we should confirm this manually: * by picking two _read1.fastq's at random, we can see that these are the barcoded reads since most of sequences end with poly-t tails. * by picking two _read2.fastq's at random, we can infer that these are cdna reads because the sequence is more varied. 1.2 barcode size and chemistry ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ next, we need to find out what 10x chemistry we are using, and we can determine that by looking at the size of our barcodes, as given in the * by picking a few random reads in a _read1.fastq file, we can count from the start of a sequence to the first 'tttt' (allowing for a few small mismatches), and we see that the barcode size is 26bp, meaning this is v2 10x chemistry. [tutorial] 2 obtaining annotation data =========================== to run the input fastq data on starsolo, we need the whitelist of cell barcodes and the gtf file with the gene annotations. 2.1 gtf and whitelist ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ from the link]: copy the urls of the *3m-february-2018.txt.gz* and *homo_sapiens.grch37.75.gtf* paste them into galaxy using the upload data dialog * wait for them to be imported into your history link] 3 running the tool finally we can run the tool using all the inputs and additional files we have obtained. 3.1 setting basic parameters ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3.1.1 setting the input pairs ----------------------------- since your fastq files are individual files and not collections, we set the *input type* to ""single files"". then, for each input pairs we set * reads* to a _read1.fastq.gz file reads* to a _read2.fastq.gz file where the should be identical for each pair of inputs. 3.1.2 (optional) multiple input pairs ------------------------------------- if you have multiple input pairs you can insert them all at once by clicking on the insert input pairs* button and repeating the above for a different. this approach comes with some advantages/disadvantages: * pro - multiple input pairs at once has the benefit of having one large all-inclusive count matrix at the end of the run. con - if just *one* of your inputs is malformed, then the entire tool fails and it will be hard to know which dataset was responsible. normally one should first try setting all inputs at once, and if that run fails, the sequential runs approach. 3.1.3 gtf and whitelist ----------------------- now we need to use our additional files. for *rna-seq cell barcode whitelist* set this to your ""3m-february-2018"" dataset. set the *custom or built-in reference genome* to ""use a built-in index"", and set the *reference genome with or without an annotation* to ""use genome reference without builtin gene-model"". for *select reference genome* set this december hg19"", since this is the version of our gtf file. then for model file for splice junctions* set this to our gtf file. 3.2 setting advanced parameters ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ now, under the *configure chemistry options* set this ranger v2"" as we determined from our barcode size before. finally we need to tell rna starsolo that the barcode size is variable due to all the poly-t bases in the barcode sequence. if you scroll down in the rna starsolo tool there is an option *barcode size is same size of the read*, which is set to yes by default. set this to ""no"". after that hit execute, and your jobs should commence! best, mehmet

[INST] hi! i have mounted the singularity containers from the galaxyproject with cvmfs and am wondering what the expected speed and responsiveness should be. currently listing the files takes a while the first time, but i think that is expected. but using a container is also a bit slow. i am in the eu and i thought it would use the freiburg mirror (cvmfs1-ufr0), also because i enabled the geoapi function. but looking at the network traffic it seems to connect the penn state psu server, which is off course far away. is this expected? or should i change something in the setup. part of the config cvmfs_server_url='http://cvmfs1-psu0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org;http://cvmfs1-iu0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org;http://cvmfs1-tacc0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org;http://cvmfs1-ufr0.galaxyproject.eu/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org;http://cvmfs1-mel0.gvl.org.au/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org' # from /cvmfs/cvmfs-config.galaxyproject.org/etc/cvmfs/domain.d/galaxyproject.org.conf cvmfs_shared_cache=yes # from cvmfs_strict_mount=no # from cvmfs_syslog_facility= cvmfs_syslog_level= cvmfs_systemd_nokill= cvmfs_timeout=5 # from cvmfs_timeout_direct=10 # from cvmfs_tracefile= cvmfs_trusted_certs= cvmfs_user=cvmfs # from /etc/cvmfs/default.conf cvmfs_use_cdn=yes # from /etc/cvmfs/default.local cvmfs_use_geoapi=yes # from /etc/cvmfs/default.local output from iftop and nethogs: # iftop server = cvmfs1-psu0.galaxyproject.org 23.1kb 32.0kb 39.1kb = 1.74mb 2.56mb 3.31mb # nethogs /sec thanks for sharing experience and insights!

[INST] i am trying to run deseq2 with featurecounts files from a single cell sequencing project. i have 8 different samples, so 8 collections of tabular files. each file has a column with geneid and a column with the count. when i try to run deseq (4 samples from one group vs 4 samples in another group) i get an error message saying: error in data.frame(…, check.names = false) : arguments imply differing number of rows: 135280, 235928, 226602, 203217, 210838, 214950, 279139, 133575 calls: get_deseq_dataset eval eval eval cbind → cbind → data.frame the report also states that: the tool was executed with one or more duplicate input datasets. this frequently results in tool errors due to problematic input choices. how can i resolve this? many thanks! [/INST] @quote trimmomatic → rnastar filter bam datasets on a variety of attributes stringtie stringtie merge gffcompare → featurecounts try this order instead, and omit gffcompare. the original protocol is creating a unified gtf to base counts on after the counts have been generated and is likely the source of the problem. trimmomatic rnastar hisat2) if using hisat2 be sure to use the output setting to create a bam dataset compatible with stringtie. this option is located under advanced options spliced alignment options transcriptome assembly reporting select the radio button for ""report alignments tailored for transcript assemblers including stringtie"") filter bam datasets on a variety of attributes – this is optional, and usually used to restrict the bam contents. i am assuming you are doing this on purpose and with a purpose specific to your analysis goals. stringtie merge enter just your reference annotation gtf under the input reference annotation to include in the merging. this ""grooms"" the gtf to a standardized format stringtie can interpret. stringtie – using the groomed gtf from step 4 stringtie merge enter the groomed gtf from step 4 plus all of the gtfs produced by stringtie in step 5 (one per sample). this step is optional and depends on how you want to do the counting. if you are only interested in known transcripts/genes, skip step 6. if you are interested in both known transcripts/genes novel transcripts/genes within your reads, run step 6 to create a unified gtf. be aware that any novel transcripts/genes that do not merge with known transcripts/genes will be named by stringtie. featurecounts – run this with the gtf output of either step 4 (known only) or step 6 (known novel), along with all bam mapped read results. proceed to deseq2 using the same exact gtf used in step 7 and the current error about count inputs having a different number of lines will resolve. note: the message about the same input count file being input twice is a common usage problem, so that warning is presented to help with troubleshooting whenever the tool fails. from your screenshot and description of the inputs to deseq2, this does not seem to be what is going on for your case. why are are removing extra header lines from gtfs created by stringtie is unclear. the reference gtf for known transcript/genes may contain extra comment lines, and those should be removed, but stringtie gtfs should contain one header line (contains sample ids). it looks like the sample id header line is in your data – so maybe i misinterpreted what you are doing. creating a unified gtf (known only, or known + novel) and using that to generate counts will then be based on the same set of transcripts/genes, and the count files will have the same number of rows (one per gene included in the unified gtf). gffcompare is a useful tool but not for deseq2 edger or limma). prior qa: searching the galaxy https://galaxyproject.org/search/?q=%22stringtie+merge%22#gsc.tab=0gsc.q=%22stringtie%20merge%22gsc.page=1) the first few results from that search points to qa that describes the solution (on our prior forum): stringtie and stringtie merge - when to apply the guide gff (reference annotation file)?

[INST] hi there, i have been running a trinity assembly to create a reference transcriptome and a gene-to-transcript map. it has been running for almost two weeks and i am wondering how i can see the progress or an estimated time for completion? recently, it switched from ""this job is currently running"" to ""this job is waiting to run"", and i would also like to know why this happened. i have been on a time crunch for a project and would really really love to have some sort of time estimate for when this tool can finish. thank you for your help! julie [/INST] @quote is there any possible way that you can unpause this job? a ""gray"" colored job is waiting for resources to become available. meaning, it is in the job queue already. @quote it is stuck in the ""waiting to run"" phase, even though previous to being stopped it was running nonstop for two weeks (in the yellow phase). @quote i am on theusegalaxy.orgserver a ""yellow"" job is actively executing. it will end in either a ""green"" (successful) or ""red"" (error) state at http://usegalaxy.org. some other public galaxy servers do this a bit differently, and will automatically rerun a job one or more times if it originally failed. an example public galaxy server that automatically reruns all failed jobs one time is @link http://usegalaxy.eu. that said, the cluster that runs trinity jobs at http://usegalaxy.org did undergo some configuration changes over the last month. some jobs were impacted and administratively rerun. my guess is that is what happened in your case as you explain it, and from what i can see in your account. the trinity job was started on feb 12. it is batched with 8 total paired-end inputs, pooled yes, and no qa/qc was done on the reads, or rather, no qa was included in the history where this work is included. the data appears to have been downloaded from sra and directly input to trinity can be set to either yes or no. for ""pooled = yes"", that means all inputs will be combined into one assembly. the datasets are quite large to be pooled, between ~10-20 gb for each end of each pair. an assembly at a public galaxy server is unlikely to be successful with that much data run as ""pooled = yes"". it will run out of resources and fail, for either runtime or memory reasons. for ""pooled = no"", there will be one assembly job/result per paired-end read input. some of your pairs would probably assemble, but it is unlikely that all would, especially the first pair in the collection as it is now (the largest, with no qa). we granted you some extra quota space already, so sent you links about the ways to use galaxy, but i also added them below again for others reading. public servers usually not a good choice for any single job that involves a very large amount of data. many smaller individual jobs are usually fine. quota space is storage space, and unrelated to the amount of memory/resources a tool uses when executing. public galaxy servers have significant computational resource allocations but not as much as what you can set up yourself in your own galaxy practical reasons). what to do from here: if you did not intend to pool the data, then you should rerun it as ""pooled = no"". you can still use a collection input. definitely do some qa first. if any of the jobs fail, then you will either need to adjust the inputs (downsample the reads with a tool like seqtk) or run the job at a galaxy server with more resources allocated (your own). if you did intend to pool the data, expect this job to fail for resource reasons. qa will not make a difference by itself at http://usegalaxy.org, but you should do some qa if/when you decide to run the job at your own galaxy server. downsampling qa might help at @link http://usegalaxy.org, but you would need to test that to see how much is needed to get a successful job and decide if the assembly using that much downsampling is still of value to you. the maximum total size of all inputs sent to a trinity job is between 20-35 gb when working at public servers. this is not exact since the size of the data is just one factor – the read content is another (and is why a qa step is strongly recommended). ways to use galaxy: webinar: webinar: use galaxy on the web, the cloud, and your laptop too (@link https://galaxyproject.org/events/2020-12-webinar-where/) ways to use galaxy: galaxy platform directory: servers, clouds, and deployable resources (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use/) decision matrix: galaxy platform directory: servers, clouds, and deployable resources (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use/#which-platform-platform-type-to-choose) the gvl version of cloudman is one choice and aws offers grants. aws programs for research and education (@link https://aws.amazon.com/grants/) hope that helps you to make some decisions about how to proceed. jen

[INST] hi, my input is 9m reads. i ran it through samtools mpileup following bwa alignment. i set the max per-file depth to 1m and i got an output of about 250,000 reads. i know i did not lose that much to quality, so why is my output number higher? i also noticed that if i set the max per file depth to anything between 300,000-1,000,000, i still get 250,000 as my output. does samtools have a read limit? [/INST] so you are expecting more then 250,000 reads per position. you could double check this with samtools depth. also in samtools mpileup you can disable the max depth by using a value of 0. edit: you also may need to rephrase your question. i also noticed that if i set the max per file depth to anything between 300,000-1,000,000, i still get 250,000 as my output. if the max is 300,000 and the depth is lower then that why would it change? i would expect a change if you set the max-depth to a lower then 250,000 value. like 8000 or something

[INST] hello. twice in the month of july i have been unable to successfully run rna star 2.7.8a on the http://usegalaxy.org server. during the first week of july i had this issue and deleted my job after a week of waiting. i am currently attempting another job, which has remained queued for the last 6 days. i am curious if this is expected behavior for this application. thank you and i apologize for the bother. [/INST] , unfortunately, it is. depending on the organism, your input data, some settings, and the day, star can take very long. for example: mapping to human in comparison to cyanobacteria takes longer. the deeper you sequence the longer it will take to map your data. use 2-pass mapping for more sensitive novel splice junction discovery activating this function also takes longer. if you use also a non-standard genome/transcriptome, which is not supported by galaxy, then star takes especially longer, because it has to first generate an index file and then runs the mapping. it could be that you have used galaxy on days, when a workshop, conference or training was given. during those peak times, jobs can take a bit longer. i hope i could clarify, why your job might have taken so long. maybe to speed up your process here are few things you can do: re-run your job, like you have done already. check a few settings for star to speed up the process (like the 2-pass mode, if you have selected it). if you have used a non-standard genome/transcriptome, then maybe it is better to first run rna star locally once to generate the index file, which can then be provided for galaxy. i hope i could help. have a good week and best wishes, florian

[INST] hello! i would like to do a metagenomics analysis with the ""metaphlan2 to profile the composition of microbial communities"" tool from galaxy and using as input file, one that is the output of joiner on paired end reads"" tool. because i would like to use the forward and reverse fastq sequences from the same sample at the same time. however, i always get an error and failure when i try this. it seems to work only with the forward or the reverse fastq sequence, but no when they´re together. someone could help me? is there specific parameters that i should have in mind? thanks! [/INST] if your method by joining the paired reads and execute methaplhan2 is the right method i do not know. but illumina data should just work. as far as i know fastq and fastqsanger is basically the same format. but the datatype ""fastqsanger"" is a galaxy way to make sure it got the ascii_base 33 quality scores. only it is possible that the galaxy tool or in other words the wrapper is created to give the output the galaxy datatype fastqsanger. but it is just a fastq file. so now you will think, why does it not work then if fastq and fastqsanger is the same format. this is because metaphlan2 has a parameter --input_type and will get the value of the galaxy datatype of the input file. if you are interested you can see it here: @link https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/blob/master/tools/metaphlan2/metaphlan2.xml in summary illumina data just works but after fastq joiner you need to change the galaxy datatype to fastq because the metaphlan2 galaxy wrapper is created that way. it has nothing to do with your data itself but with galaxy. if, but i highly doubt it you got ascii_base 64 quality score you could use something like https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/fastq_groomer here a page with the scores: @link https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html

[/INST] ok, the second reply helps me to understand. stringtie – the inputs are mapped reads. whatever ever was mapped against is where the coordinates are derived from. all other inputs that are coordinate-based need to be based on that exact same reference genome. you mapped against the hg38 reference genome at this step in the tutorial (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/de-novo/tutorial.html#mapping). you can incorporate reference annotation during mapping and/or transcript assembly and/or transcript merging merge), then will also include the reference annotation for later steps (differential expression: featurecounts and deseq2 if following the tutorial). the reference annotation that is first used represents the known genes/transcripts for your genome. you will still capture novel transcripts if you use one. the different tool forms will state the choices: create transcripts that are known (only – those included in the annotation) or create known plus novel. you can run it both ways in different tools and compare. as you move through the analysis, the reference annotation will be updated and reformatted at certain steps. the updated version at an earlier step is what you want to use in the next downstream steps. the hg38 reference annotation gtf is now best sourced from ucsc. not from the table browser but from the downloads area here (@link https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/bigzips/genes/). there are a few gene tracks to choose from. you can review what each of those represents then upload the selected gtf to galaxy with the upload tool. just copy and paste in the url and leave all other settings at the default. the correct datatype will be assigned. @quote for the sake of consistency, should i just use the gtf file in my history for hisat2 and move forward from there? i am not sure what that annotation represents or where you sourced it, but some data providers create gtf data that are not quite in the correct format. it is also possible you have annotation with chromosome identifers that are a mismatch for hg38. i would stick with the ucsc gtf if this analysis is new to you – nothing special needs to be done to prepare it for use with tools. but if you really want to use another source, gencode is probably the best alternative. you will need to remove the header lines and then update the datatype first. instructions are in this prior qa (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/reference-genome-and-associated-gene-model-gtf-gff3-file-for-splice-junctions-in-rna-star/4365). note: you may find prior qa that specifically states to avoid the ucsc gtf. that was about using the version from the table browser before ucsc started generating properly formatted gtf data available in the downloads area for all of their genomes that had a gene annotation track. in my opinion, the version of hg38 reference annotation in the ucsc downloads area is now absolutely the best choice. especially if you choose the refseq gene annotation as that one is updated regularly, about monthly. other gene tracks are fixed at prior releases. other data sources may need reformatting and some are missing important attributes. but you can review and decide. or maybe run distinct analysis paths with the different gtf choices and compare results. however you do this start with a specific annotation gtf then keep using that throughout the same analysis. meaning: do not switch from refseq to ensembl in the middle of an analysis or expect problems. there is another problem in that case because if i try to use a reference from my history, i cannot seem to select gtf files, only ones in a fasta format… for this, my guess is that you are mixing up where to input a reference annotation versus a reference genome or reference transcriptome (fasta) on the tool forms. your analysis will include all three. a reference annotation will be selected from the history for your use case. featurecounts does have annotation available for a few genomes, including hg38, but that is for when you do not need annotation for any other steps – and it will not match external sources – so do not mix that in for now. a reference transcriptome will be selected from the history (always). a reference genome for your case is the already indexed built-in version of hg38. technically you can input a reference genome from the history, too, but that only works for very small genomes and there is no need if galaxy has already indexed it. that should cover all the questions/problems you were having. please try this out :slight_smile:

[INST] hi, i have been trying to annotate vcf.gz files that i have using the snpeff tool on galaxy. they are human samples so i am using the hg19 genome as the snpff genome version name. i keep getting the following error message - i am guessing from the error message that it has to do with the fact that the reference and alternate bases are not single bases and rather 2 bases (tg and ca, respectively, in the below example) - is that the case? how can i resolve this error? gatk was used for variant calling. picked up _java_options: error: error while processing vcf entry (line 176) : chr1 16890671. tg ca 125.238 pass af=0.53012;ao=44;dp=84;fao=44;fdp=83;fdvr=10;fr=.;fro=39;fsaf=21;fsar=23;fsrf=20;fsrr=19;fwdb=-0.0269551;fxx=0.0119048;hrun=1;hs_only=0;len=2;mlld=170.568;oalt=ca;oid=.;omapalt=ca;opos=16890671;oref=tg;pb=0.5;pbp=1;ppd=0;qd=6.03554;rbi=0.0269856;refb=0.0133951;revb=-0.00128241;ro=39;saf=21;sar=23;spd=0;srf=20;srr=19;ssen=0;ssep=0;sssb=-0.0302714;stb=0.516705;stbp=0.775;type=mnp;varb=-0.00753567 gt:gq:dp:fdp:ro:fro:ao:fao:af:sar:saf:srf:srr:fsar:fsaf:fsrf:fsrr 0/1:91:84:83:39:39:44:44:0.53012:23:21:20:19:23:21:20:19 java.lang.stringindexoutofboundsexception: string index out of range: 3 java.lang.stringindexoutofboundsexception: string index out of range: 3 at java.lang.string.substring(string.java:1963) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.hgvsprotein.simplifyaminoacidsleft(hgvsprotein.java:395) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.hgvsprotein.simplifyaminoacids(hgvsprotein.java:384) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.hgvsprotein.tostring(hgvsprotein.java:491) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.varianteffect.gethgvsprot(varianteffect.java:633) at org.snpeff.vcf.vcfeffect.set(vcfeffect.java:1031) at org.snpeff.vcf.vcfeffect.(vcfeffect.java:147) at org.snpeff.outputformatter.vcfoutputformatter.addinfo(vcfoutputformatter.java:98) at org.snpeff.outputformatter.vcfoutputformatter.tostring(vcfoutputformatter.java:286) at org.snpeff.outputformatter.outputformatter.endsection(outputformatter.java:112) at org.snpeff.outputformatter.vcfoutputformatter.endsection(vcfoutputformatter.java:230) at org.snpeff.outputformatter.outputformatter.printsection(outputformatter.java:145) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.commandline.snpeffcmdeff.annotate(snpeffcmdeff.java:292) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.commandline.snpeffcmdeff.annotatevcf(snpeffcmdeff.java:468) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.commandline.snpeffcmdeff.annotate(snpeffcmdeff.java:142) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.commandline.snpeffcmdeff.run(snpeffcmdeff.java:1029) at org.snpeff.snpeffect.commandline.snpeffcmdeff.run(snpeffcmdeff.java:984) at org.snpeff.snpeff.run(snpeff.java:1183) at org.snpeff.snpeff.main(snpeff.java:162) thank you in advance for your help. [/INST] , the error is related to the fact that the vcf line does not encode a simple snp but an mnp, yes, but is not directly caused by it. it rather seems that snpeff, after having completed the annotation of the line internally, tries to simplfy the amino acid change it is going to report by stripping off leading and trailing identical amino acids. let us assume for example: in your tg → ca change, the t-c is silent (leaving say an ala unaltered), but g-a changes a leu-ser (completely making this up of course). then the original aa change annotation would be alaleu → alaser, but obviously that could be simplified to just leu → ser. now the problem is that snpeff assumes in that simplifying code that amino acids are encoded in 3-letter code at this point. for some reason that does not seem to be true in your case, but you seem to arrive at that piece of code with single-letter code (like al as in the example). now when the code tries to compare the first three letters of the left string to the first three letters of the right one, it fails with that string index out of range: 3 from the error message. looking for an explanation of why you arrive there with one letter codes, i can only think of the setting: use one letter amino acid codes in hgvs notation. e.g. p.r47g instead of p.arg47gly in the snpeff annotation options. maybe that is what is incompatible with mnps? just guessing here, but if you have checked that option, just try rerunning without it. good luck, wolfgang

[INST] trying to use wig/bedgraph-to-bigwig tool for a file generated with mapping to chm13 t2t but the bedgraph file i am trying to convert does not allow me to designate the reference genome as chm13 t2t (it does not come up on the list). [/INST] @quote runtimeerror: invalid interval bounds! this part of the error indicates a mismatch between the chromosomes + coordinates between the two inputs. double check that all are based on the exact same reference genome assembly/build. you have mentioned both hg38 and chm13_t2t_v2.0 so i am not sure which this was based on, but using data anchored to one assembly for all inputs will work best. those two are close enough that you might not realize there is a mismatch problem at first. content issues do not always trigger a tool failure, instead, tools can produce odd ""putatively successful"" results that have a scientific problem.

[INST] hello, i was looking into the web hooks available in galaxy and from what i can tell, in terms of job scheduling, the only hook available is once the job is submitted by the user. there does not seem to be a hook which can be triggered when a job begins running on a cluster (using slurm for scheduling on our hpc), or when it finishes (either success or fail). would it be possible for me to add something like this to my galaxy install, or perhaps there is an easier way to do so. ideally this would be for all tools, so it is not quite feasible to edit all the tool xmls and add custom execution code. essentially what i would want is to post to a url (external rest api) with a certain message (begin or end fail or end success, and the submitting user's username) when jobs begin or finish. any suggestions are appreciated! [/INST] you should definitely look at an alternative to modifying galaxy. most users do not own their copy of galaxy and you will struggle to convince sys-admins to maintain custom deployments of galaxy. i also cannot think of a reason someone would need immediate notification of a job completing. if the job takes longer than the person is willing to wait, they usually go off and do other things and come back when they are ready. galaxy does offer the option to send an email upon job completion. you could look into making a contribution to galaxies code base, extending this existing functionality.

[INST] hi there, i need to upload the fasta file of my reference genome to galaxy as a dataset and change the settings in history to allow me to select that reference genome when i import gene data of the organism that i performed rnaseq analysis on. i really need help with this please, the species i need is not in the standard database that galaxy allows you to choose from when importing data. any help will be greatly appreciated. j [/INST] this did not work for two reasons: @quote the url i am using ishttps://workflow4metabolomics.usegalaxy.fr/(i basically just want to use the workflow4metabolomics steps to analyse my data by pls-da analysis).i enter this into the filezilla host fieldftp://usegalaxy.org the ftp url is always specific to the server you are working on, and your account there. i do not see the current ftp url on their site, but you could ask them. usually, it is the last part of the server url (for this case that would be ""@link http://usegalaxy.fr"") – but not always. they have a forum specific for their community where the information may be posted, see: workflow4metabolomics - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use/workflow4metabolomics/) if you are ever working at http://usegalaxy.org, the ftp url is ""@link http://usegalaxy.org"" – without the ""ftp://"" at the start. this help applies to most public galaxy servers that support ftp. the ftp url will be the last part of the server url, or the server, or help on their server or directory page will specify what to use or how to ask about details. all known public galaxy servers are in the directory here do not use this forum, or have a supplemental forum or contact): galaxy platform directory: servers, clouds, and deployable resources - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use) @quote however, my datasets are in csv file format. what happens if you convert csv to tabular format and input that instead? click on the pencil icon for the dataset to reach the edit attributes forms, click into the second tab named and find the option in the drop-down menu. only a few tools interpret csv (comma-separated values) and most expect tabular (tab-separated values). the tool form will usually note what is expected/supported in the help section with examples. another quick way to find out for any tool: create a new empty history, then load up a tool form. the options on the form where input datasets are selected will list out the expected input datatype(s). that server is set up a bit differently than other public servers, with special tools/workflows etc. their forum is probably the best place to ask questions if you run into problems. there could be a known problem or you might be the first to report something they could fix. hope that helps!

[INST] trying to use bbmap on an uploaded fastq dataset but it shows as unavailable. also does this if i upload fastq.gz and unzip in galaxy. wondering how to get around this. data is originally pacbio. thanks. [/INST] most tools in galaxy expect reads in fastqsanger or fastqsanger.gz format and with one of those datatypes assigned. those datatypes represent a specific type of quality score scaling: sanger phred this is produced by illumina 1.8+ pipelines. pacbio used phred+33 scaling to start with and now the scaling is neutral. you can double check with a tool like fastqc or fastq info to see what those report. there are some tools that expect just fastq or fastq.gz (scaling unspecified). but if you are ever not sure what datatype(s) a tool accepts as input, any tool not just those that accept reads, try this: create a new empty history load up the tool form review the input datatypes listed in the tool form's input area note: a tool could have more than one input area and this works for all user-supplied inputs from the history. example what-datatype-is-accepted-input (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/e/e526ccad7216bc30f1408215478e172bbae0cda4.png)

[INST] what is going on?! i had 75% of my space quota full just yesterday and now, when i returned today everything is gone! the history has been purged. clean. zero. i had not received emails, no warnings… i have just only one account with galaxy. admins, what is going on? [/INST] @user you had this account restored back in january 2021 after it was administratively suspended then purged as a duplicate account in october 2020. once enabled again, you created more work in a history that was technically purged and already had the old datasets in it purged. old or new data in a purged history will continue to be screened for and removed every 14 days. there is a technical corner-case problem on our side but it will only present when an account has been administratively managed. specifically, one of your histories was not labeled as purged in the gui until this last cycle of administrative cleanup. the other histories were labeled as purged and could not be worked in, and now this one is, too. until we correct that, anyone with an enabled administratively managed account should not create new work in any history that has a creation date earlier than the date the account was re-enabled. or better, simply avoid using multiple accounts to start with. terms of use are one account per person at each distinct public galaxy server, including http://usegalaxy.org. getting an account at galaxy main (http://usegalaxy.org) (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account/) we are sorry that you lost your new work in that single history with the wrong state assigned when the account was re-enabled. but the good news is that there was not much new work, and there is one new history you created/worked in after the account was re-enabled and it was not impacted. in our email communications in january 2021, you asked for the account to be enabled with or without prior data. i re-explained the terms of usage and how you can proactively resolve multiple accounts yourself before those are administratively managed for breaking the terms of service. the processes that detect and remove multiple accounts that are in use by the same person do not always capture all of the multiple accounts an individual may have. but everyone can fix this if the terms were unclear: consolidate data into one account and delete any extras under user preferences. follow the terms of service and there are never problems. my account were active last night and running data, however this morning i tried logging in to find a message saying the account had been marked as deleted. how do i recover the data that was in the account? thanks for helping to keep http://usegalaxy.org a free and fair public resource for researchers worldwide.

[INST] hi, everyone i am familiar with galaxy, but only now have i started setting it up on our local computer server, just a well-built computer running in unix). i have succeeded to install it, set admin accounts, download reference files (i.e. reference genomes) and install new packages. my problem now is, how can i set directories to store data reference files, output files, and temp job files, if possible)? moreover, how to set them to a location on another disk volume, other than the one galaxy was installed? i have tried troubleshooting from this official link https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/data-managers/how-to/define/) and this post (@link https://biostar.galaxyproject.org/p/11020/), but i cannot make it work. for one thing, i believe the galaxy.ini file has been replaced by galaxy.yml file. is that correct? if so, i found some lines similar to what is referenced on the official link, and did the following changes: on line 178, it reads: # on any cluster nodes that will run galaxy jobs, unless using pulsar. file_path: /media/mol/hdmol/galaxy/database/files # where temporary files are stored. it must accessible at the same # path on any cluster nodes that will run galaxy jobs, unless using # pulsar. new_file_path: /media/mol/hdmol/galaxy/database/tmp note: /media/mol/hdmol is the path to the other disk volume. and all sub-directories from galaxy were copied to that location. hence, i as using the exact same sub-directories, and changing only the volume any help is very much appreciated. thank you! [/INST] first, that is not a valid xml (it misses two closing tags). second, i think you do not want to use hierarchical or distributed os, so something like this should suffice: third, make sure you tell galaxy about this store configuration by putting it in the galaxy.yml object_store_config_file: config/object_store_conf.xml

[INST] hi all, i created a bash script that runs a tool and then it takes some of the output files put them in a directory that i have created for this tool and copy them into some bash variables: cp cp therefore in the xml tool definition file that runs this bash script i specify this outputs: sh so i force galaxy to put this scripts in a directory created by me. is this wrong? or should i let galaxy put the output files in the default directory? [/INST] yes, but you remove the folder after you moved or copied it to galaxy. so it will be the very last line of the bash script. and are basically paths.

[INST] hi i am using paired end data and downloaded the sra file from ncbi and uploaded it on galaxy server. and can i use this data directly for assembly or first i have to split the files then use it [/INST] for your trinity questions: trinity requires that paired-end inputs are ""matched pairs"". meaning, both ends of the same read are input. if one of the ends fails qa/qc fastp, others), then the other associated end cannot be used, even if it happens to passes qa. when extracting from srr, the original data will be paired. when running through qa tools, the data can become un-paired. that said, the output from qa tools, for example trimmomatic, the data will be sorted into four datasets. paired forward paired reverse = use these for assembly inputs single forward single reverse = do not use these for assembly inputs. one end of the original pair did not pass qa, and the assembly will fail if input. please be aware of a few current factors that can impact assembly success/failures when using the public galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org server right now. there is a banner on the server explaining. more details: trinity and unicycler are running with reduced memory allocation at this time. make sure to use the most current version of all tools, or unexpected problems can occur. the most current version of any tool's form will load from the tool panel. if your job fails, confirm that you are using the most current tool version. if not, rerun using the updated version. if yes, then the failure may be due to the reduced memory resources. try one rerun. if that fails again, there may be some other problem with your inputs. how to check for common input problems is discussed in the topic below. my inputs are ok how to work-around the reduced memory allocation? a) consider using an alternative public galaxy server (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use/) b) decide if down/sub-sampling your inputs will meet your goals (see seqtk tools). @quote check to see if there is a known usegalaxy.* server issue. server status:https://status.galaxyproject.org/if the server was down when you first ran your job, try a rerun once back up. a rerun can also eliminate transient server issues too short in duration to trigger a statuspage warning. next, start by reviewing the troubleshooting faq. common reasons and solutions for tool errors are explained. most job errors can be resolved by correcting your input data's format/content. others indica… hope that helps!

[INST] i am following along with a tutorial given on the coursera genomic data science course. it involved first joining two datasets on a column column to produce another data set. then it involves grouping the resultant dataset on a column. in the video it shows that there is a drop down list of column names from the dataset being grouped to pick from. no such drop down appears. when i tried typing the column name in from the dataset it seems to have ignored it when executing the task with an error indicating that no column was specified. any suggestions?

[INST] dear galaxy team, i would like to perform paired-end rna seq analysis for 21 samples with all of them having a biological replicate. i would like to know how should i build a dataset list for such a cohort. should one data list have all r1 and the other datalist have all r2 to be able to run commands on all sample at once? and how should i account the biological replicates? thank you very much in advance for your help! best, shweta [/INST] , there are different options; since you have technical replicates, i suggest you build a list of dataset pairs for each sample and its technical replicate. assuming that you are going to follow this pipeline: cutadapt rnastar featurecounts → deseq2 you can work with that collections until the deseq2 stage. then you need to merge the technical replicates together in order to use them in deseq2, which can be done by using two tools: column join on multiple datasets (@link https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/collection_column_join/collection_column_join/0.0.3): it allows you to collapse the the technical replicates collections into a single count file with three columns (geneid, counts replicate 1 and counts replicate 2). table compute computes operations on table data (@link https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/table_compute/table_compute/1.2.4+galaxy0): it will allow you to sum up the count of each replicate. regards

[INST] hi. this is my first time using galaxy and i got stuck straight away so it might be a basic error that i have done but i have been following step by step tutorials and cannot figure out what is wrong. i could not find any help from previous messages. i have 2 kinds of errors when trying to run an assembly with unicycler. first i have an issue when i try to select the reads i want to use. when i scroll down, i do not see every reads, even though they are loaded properly. when i use the ""search"" instead and choose the right read, it turns from green to white and ""unavailable"" appears before the name of the read like in the screen shot below: (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/0/01f154e935238e24d7ee87e8c4b0c948222dc77a.png) i tried to use the very few reads that appear in the scroll down menu and it is working! but i cannot access all the reads (anything before entry ""52"" is unavailable, which is most of my data). when i try to run an assembly anyway with the reads saying ""unavailable"", i get the error message: tool error an error occurred with this dataset: failed to communicate with remote job server. can anybody help? should i reload all my reads data? thanks vanina [/INST] nanopore reads can be in either fasta or fastqsanger format. when uploading, allowing galaxy to assign the datatype is usually best but you can change this after upload if galaxy guessed incorrectly. why multiple files failed upload this could be due to a few reasons, including a slower internet connection. most residential wifi is optimized for data downloads, not uploads, and many are still working from home right now. maybe try using ftp to load the data instead of browsing local files? if any transfer fails, it can be resumed. i added a few tags to this post that will point to details about using ftp for upload. also, if you are ever not sure about which datatypes a tool is expecting for input, try this: create a new empty history, then load up the tool form. be aware that if data is compressed fastqsanger.gz), galaxy will uncompress the data at runtime additional hidden datasets) for tools that require uncompressed input. sometimes it is better to uncompress yourself first (pencil icon convert), then purge the original compressed, to avoid too much data duplication/quota usage. a side effect is that whatever tool you are running might run better since it does not have to do the step as a pre-processing step for the primary tool. for larger work, that can often make a difference between a successful or failed job fails due to resource reasons). example: unicycler (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/c/c53458e5a7af2aade5cdbdc2c4ce77d2f6e2c579.png) hope that gives some options that will work for you, if you have not found a solution yet.

changes over time in sequencing protocols and the sra submission process itself and in how ncbi creates/standardizes the ""processed"" read data then versus now, and probably some other historical things i do not know or cannot remember :slight_smile: confusing but should not matter now, as format issues will be avoided with the faster tool, and you are using that now. fastq info this is different. it is the output from the tool, and it happens to also be in a job log. fastq_utils 0.25.1 default_hashsize=39000001 scanning and indexing all reads from /corral4/main/objects/9/4/8/dataset_94835bb6-102b-4cdf-9484-a19ea90a0d6c.dat read name provided with no suffix 10000020000030000040000050000060000070000080000090000010000001100000120000013000001400000150000016000001700000180000019000002000000210000022000002300000240000025000002600000270000028000002900000300000031000003200000330000034000003500000360000037000003800000390000040000004100000420000043000004400000450000046000004700000480000049000005000000510000052000005300000540000055000005600000570000058000005900000600000061000006200000630000064000006500000660000067000006800000690000070000007100000720000073000007400000750000076000007700000780000079000008000000810000082000008300000840000085000008600000870000088000008900000900000091000009200000930000094000009500000960000097000009800000990000010000000101000001020000010300000104000001050000010600000107000001080000010900000110000001110000011200000113000001140000011500000116000001170000011800000119000001200000012100000122000001230000012400000125000001260000012700000128000001290000013000000131000001320000013300000134000001350000013600000137000001380000013900000140000001410000014200000143000001440000014500000146000001470000014800000149000001500000015100000152000001530000015400000155000001560000015700000158000001590000016000000161000001620000016300000164000001650000016600000167000001680000016900000170000001710000017200000173000001740000017500000176000001770000017800000 error: error in file /corral4/main/objects/9/4/8/dataset_94835bb6-102b-4cdf-9484-a19ea90a0d6c.dat: line 71398384: file truncated input dataset 32 – datatype/format fastqsanger.gz output dataset 253 successful result how to interpret this: the fastq info tool ran successfully (did not fail itself) and it reported back a problem it found in the input. this test history i created a few months ago has an example that matches your use case (artificially created). i will leave this shared as a reference. galaxy | accessible history | test fastq_info (@link https://usegalaxy.org/you/jen-galaxyproject/h/test-fastqinfo) how to catch these: these are text files so are simple to parse/filter/combine. even if all the data is in a collection, you will be able to tell which datasets any errors are from. i just did this two different ways in that shared history as examples and there are likely 100+ ways to do this. anything ""text manipulation"" you can do on the command line can usually be done in galaxy, with the bonus of being able to add that to workflows, see @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/tutorial.html#cheatsheet thanks again and hope that helps!

[INST] hi everyone, i am trying to use an rna-seq pipeline to analyze my own data for c. elegans. every time i try to upload the gtf file download from ucsf, wormbase, or ensemble, i get the following error message error occurred setting the metadata for this dataset"". after one day trying different options on solving the problem, i have tried to upload the same dataset on the @link http://galaxy.eu in which i did not receive any error. this made me to think that there is no problem with the file itself. may i ask if there is a bug on the @link http://galaxy.org my local galaxy server and if it is possible to fix it? thank you so much! ini [/INST] data upload problems are usually the first indicator of some configuration problem after a new galaxy is first started up. that said, sometimes odd errors, including this one, are produced when a file is not completely uploaded (new server or not). there could be many reasons for that with a local galaxy server. a local galaxy needs some admin configuration to be used without problems coming up. some of this we can help with and some of this will be specific to your computer/network that we cannot help with (since it is private) but we do have documentation that covers the basic setup and use cases. @quote galaxy resourcesquick start:get galaxy - galaxy community hubtutorials:galaxy training!docs:galaxy documentation galaxy project 21.09.1.dev0 documentation there will be a training event in march that includes administrative topics. many of the tutorials linked above will be included. anyone can join. the event is global, asynchronous, and many more people from the community will be available to help. gtn smörgåsbord 2: 14-18 march gallantries (@link https://gallantries.github.io/posts/2021/12/14/smorgasbord2-tapas/) you can also go through those tutorials on your own now and try to uncover the problem, or at least be able to provide more context about your configuration so the community can assist here. examples of information that will help: galaxy version, computer os/version, dependency management choice(s), what admin configurations you have done, plus how some tests worked out. have you installed tools and run tool tests? the goal is to find out things like: do other datasets load properly? this same file type fails (always/sometimes? from different sources or just one particular source?). do other data upload successfully – or do all uploads fail? has any upload ever worked? have any tools ever worked? if the analysis was successful before, have you made any changes since things worked? what may be best if you do not want to go through all the administrative setup/tests, and this is a new server that you have not heavily invested in already: try an alternative deployment choice. docker galaxy comes with more of the administrative details pre-configured. details here: galaxy docker - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use/galaxy-docker/)

[INST] hi everyone! i started a unicycler run two days ago (07/08/2023) on a set of 87 paired reads. everything went fine ok, 4 with errors) until yesterday morning when i noticed two jobs were running and 1 was waiting for quite a long time. past issues solved themselves with time and the problem was me being impatient so i decided to wait, today these two jobs are still running and the other one is still waiting, so i suspect something is off. should i keep on waiting? thanks a lot! [/INST] @quote by the way, things are still unchanged the jobs look failed now, so you could try rerunning. @quote i did not try it yet but would it be possible to download the assembled reads even if the collection has not been processed as a whole? if so, i might do this and retry the assembly with the affected reads. yes, you can filter a collection to exclude empty or failed datasets: see tools in the group collection operations. @quote if so, i might do this and retry the assembly with the affected reads. do you mean create a new collection with just those datasets that did not process with the batch? if yes, you can go into the hidden datasets tab in the history, unhide the inputs, create a new collection out of them, then run those. later on if that works, you could combined the two collections together again (original results + rerun results). that said, the usual way is to rerun those elements again while in the collection making sure to check the box to replace back into the original output collection. and, you could get fancy with filtering by element identifiers but with so few datasets and no workflow considerations, just doing it directly might be faster. so that is a few ways to go forward. hope one works out for you!

[INST] hi, the download links for bam output files (13g) from markduplicate and addorreplacereadgroups are downloading only few mbs of html file rather bam. i tried using both and also tried to transfer these files to @link http://useglaxy.org server but it failed. please tell me how to download appropriate files or what is the problem with copy link option. thanks [/INST] good detective work. the how-to is a bit different at eu. maybe someone already discovered how this works, but in case not: http://usegalaxy.eu is set up to have all data private and not publically accessible by url. if you are trying to move data between servers, the accounts are distinct, so the sharing state needs to be set at eu to be more permissive to transfer data by url to anywhere else galaxy servers, external cloud storage, etc). try this: go to the history that contains the dataset pull down the history menu and click into share or publish. set the first option to share the history by link, and make sure that the dataset you want to share is included. you do not need to publish. go back to your history with the dataset then copy/paste the dataset link other places (other galaxy servers upload tool). unshare the history or leave it in a shared state. adjusting privacy settings for your account: accounts at any of the usegalaxy.* servers have the options to adjust the default sharing status for what is most convenient for you. it would be very unlikely for anyone to guess what a random link is, let alone understand what that data represents, but any access at all has to be an explicit opt-in at the eu server for gdpr reasons. to see how it works – try doing the reverse between the org server to the eu server without any changes. the data will transfer unless you set up the account preferences to be different from the default. another way to see how it works is to toggle the first of these two global settings at eu in user preferences, create a new history, add a new dataset, and what happens when transferring that dataset by url. data created before the toggle will not be impacted, data created after will be. the second setting makes more permanent changes to all current data (everything has the state changed to private) but know that this cannot be undone with one change. instead, you would need to directly reshare any histories (and the datasets contained) / workflows / etc that were previously shared if that matters to you. set dataset permissions for new histories grant others default access to newly created histories. changes made here will only affect histories created after these settings have been stored. and make all data private click here to make all data private. downloading to a local desktop from the :floppy_disk: works at eu with any sharing state since when you are logged into your own account, your account is assumed to be private and only directly accessible by you, and only while logged in. i am not sure if the api key is needed for wget at the eu server. the eu team can advise, or someone can test that out and post back what works and does not at the different servers. we could make an faq to capture the information in one place, and attribute your account here, or better, your github account. the march 24th webinar here has more details. we went over the account preferences options then ran through a collaborate-by-sharing demonstration: galaxy-elixir webinars series: advanced features | elixir (@link https://elixir-europe.org/events/galaxy-elixir-webinars-series-advanced-features). hope that helps!

[INST] hi, i am currently in the middle of my uni project and i am trying to follow an rna-seq hisat pipeline to analyse reads obtained from ncbi gene expression omnibus i have got the data, and tried to put it through hisat. did not work and came back with error messages, realised that i probably should have put it through fastqc/trimmomatic first. tried however, it did not accept or recognise any fastq files, could not understand why til i looked at the data files. it seems that i had ""fastq.gzreadspergene.out.tab.gz"" instead of normal fastq files. apparently from what i have been told, i have got from geo are mixed messages. the first part would represent raw ngs reads, which should either be in fastqsanger format or can be converted to fastqsanger. if fastqc does not run and will not accept the files then it is unlikely they are in a fastq format. the second part ""readspergene.out.tab.gz"" suggests these are aligned sequences with gene counts. so i have now been trying to determine whether these files are in fastq format or not. tried to convert the files using fastq groomer, did not accept the files. fastqc did not accept them so i am assuming they are not in fastq format. tried running through hisat again and i just encounter the same errors as before. i have looked almost everywhere to see if i can fix this problem and i have emailed again to ask what to do as i am relatively new to using this tool. does anyone know how i resolve this issue? this was all done on my uni's galaxy server.

[INST] dear galaxy users, i am trying to analyse some 16s rrna data following the galaxy tutorial. when i run the unique.seqs call i get the following message: an error occured while running the tool toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/mothur_unique_seqs/mothur_unique_seqs/1.39.5.0. tool execution generated the following messages: fatal error: exit code 137 line 25: 31810 done echo 'unique.seqs(fasta=fasta.dat, format=name)' 31811 | sed 's/ //g' 31812 killed | mothur 31813 | tee mothur.out.log do you know why this keeps happening? the previous call was the screen.seqs() and was successful. nick [/INST] ok, that does help to confirm that memory is the root problem. please see the galaxy administrator help for how to increase memory allocation for tools. this tuning is usually most appropriate for those that are running jobs on a cluster, which might not be your case. by default, when running galaxy locally, job memory is limited by whatever hardware you have natively available on your computer. 16 gb is considered the minimum, but many tools and certainly large datasets can need more. you might want to consider moving to a cloud version of galaxy if you plan to process large data. see: @link https://galaxyproject.org/choices/ @link https://galaxyproject.org/use/

[INST] i have been trying to use a genome build for sheep gold fasta) for mapping single end rnaseq data with bowtie2. no matter what i try, downstream use of the mapped bam output with featurecounts fails give give any counts. i have tried all the options/advice described under the help section, but to no avail. any possibility that the sheep genome (and if possible the goat genome) could be added as built-ins for bowtie2? [/INST] , the genomes are now available. regards

[INST] hi everybody. i am developing a tool that allows to choose between different options for a query. now my code is inside a python file where for each type of query i have a different function. following this guide (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-integration/slides.html#22) i created the file and everything is running correctly without errors when i start galaxy. the problem is that when i run the tool every option) i get this error: job submission failed. the server could not complete this request. please verify your parameter settings, retry submission and contact the galaxy team if this error persists. a transcript of the submitted data is shown below. in the terminal i get this: galaxy.tools error 2022-02-28 11:43:36,932 [pn:main.web.1,p:13472,w:1,m:0,tn:uwsgiworker1core0] exception caught while attempting to execute tool with id 'impc_test': traceback (most recent call last): file line 80, in fill_template return unicodify(t, log_exception=false) file line 1060, in unicodify value str(value) file ""/users/andrea/desktop/galaxy/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cheetah/template.py"", line 1053, in __unicode__ return getattr(self, mainmethname)() file line 91, in respond eoferror: eof when reading a line during handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: traceback (most recent call last): file line 1770, in handle_single_execution flush_job=flush_job, file line 1858, in execute return self.tool_action.execute(self, trans, incoming=incoming, set_output_hid=set_output_hid, history=history, file line 529, in execute handle_output(name, output) file line 455, in handle_output data.name self.get_output_name(output, data, tool, on_text, trans, incoming, history, wrapped_params.params, job_params) file line 784, in get_output_name return fill_template(output.label, context=params, python_template_version=tool.python_template_version) file line 124, in fill_template python_template_version=python_template_version, file line 126, in fill_template raise first_exception or e file line 80, in fill_template return unicodify(t, log_exception=false) file line 1060, in unicodify value str(value) file ""/users/andrea/desktop/galaxy/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cheetah/template.py"", line 1053, in __unicode__ return getattr(self, mainmethname)() file line 89, in respond eoferror: eof when reading a line galaxy.tools.execute warning 2022-02-28 11:43:36,932 [pn:main.web.1,p:13472,w:1,m:0,tn:uwsgiworker1core0] there was a failure executing a job for tool - error executing tool with id 'impc_test': eof when reading a line here is the .py code that i am using as test and its xml file: test.py (here i do not have functions since i am making tests on the input which is the part that, in my opinion, is raising the error) import sys import argparse import requests import pandas as pd import numpy as np def main(): # define options parser = argparse.argumentparser(description=__doc__) parser.add_argument(""-k"", ""--option"", type=str, help=""option selected"") # parse args parser.parse_args() option str(args.option) if option 'q1': print(""hello 1! input:"" sys.argv[1]) textfile open(sys.argv[2], textfile.write(""here is the input of first query:"" sys.argv[1] textfile.close() elif option print(""hello 2! input:"" sys.argv[1]) textfile open(sys.argv[2], textfile.write(""here is the input of second query:"" sys.argv[1] textfile.close() else: sys.exit(""error!"") if __name__ main() test.xml for impc query selection requests pandas numpy python3 '$query_type.input' '$output' $option str($selector) --option $option first second just a test for impc queries. essentially, i am trying to set 'option' on different values so inside the code i can use it to call different functions. thank you all for the help.

[INST] hi, when i try to run galaxy local, i get the message installation requested and failed"". error: did not recognise option 'book/galaxy/galaxy/database/dependencies/_conda', please try -h i have gone into the galaxy.yml file and amended it as so: conda_prefix: tool_dependency_dir: dependencies conda_auto_init: true i cannot understand what the issue is. despite this, it allows me to open galaxy on the web and download tools but the tools do not work. any help would be much appreciated!! [/INST] ah! i think you have problems because of the space in your path. look at the error: did not recognize option and look at the path that it should be: book/galaxy/galaxy/database/dependencies/_conda try to change book to something like besides your problem now you should not have spaces in folder or file names. good luck and let us know if this solved it.

[INST] dear support team at galaxy, i have recently performed a chip-seq experiment and i have just got my raw seq files from the seq service. i would like to perform my analysis but each of my samples was sequenced twice; meaning that each sample has two seq files. this is because each sample was sequenced twice to get a workable number of total reads (because of very low concentration of my chiped dna). thus, i am looking for a tool in galaxy that will allow me to merge the two seq files of the same samples in to just one, with whom i will then proceed to the mapping with bowtie2, the peak calling with macs2 etc. could you please propose me a tool that i can properly perform such a task of merging? many thanks in advance, greetings, manolis [/INST] this tool tends to work best with uncompressed inputs. please try uncompressing the inputs, then run the tool. galaxy does some intermediate steps to transform the data during processing (in this case: fastq plain text fastq). when compressed fastq is input, sometimes a compression version is not exactly what is expected at a technical level. uncompressing first will usually avoid problems with any text manipulation tool. to uncompress a fastqsanger.gz dataset: click on the pencil icon to reach the edit attributes functions click into the convert tab the drop-down menu will include a choice to produce an uncompressed version of the data (these will be new datasets) run the concatinate tool on the uncompressed fastqsanger datasets after everything is completely done and confirmed to be correct, go back and permanently delete (purge) the original compressed data to remove it from your quota usage. i tested this out last week for another person exact tool/problem) and it worked, but please let us know if that does not work for your case and we can troubleshoot more. :slight_smile:

[INST] hi i am studying on a plant that has no reference genome and only has one scaffold assembly and one gff3 annotation file. if i want to do de novo assembly using the galaxy can i import the links of 20 fastq files from the rna-seq of the samples together to construct the reference genome with trinity? if this is possible, please help me import the links of these files together into galaxy and make the reference genome. maximum number of samples or data can be used for deno assembly in galaxy? thanks a lot [/INST] welcome, @user in short, yes you can assemble within galaxy. trinity is designed to assemble rna-seq reads into a transcriptome assembly genome). genome assembly from wgs reads works best with smaller genomes (procaryotic) when working at public galaxy servers due to resources is one tool choice for that purpose). the reads need to be prepared and input properly. the upper limit of what can be assembled is usually based more on the read content and genome size/characteristics, rather than the volume/size of the read data. you will not know until you try, to see how your data will assemble at any particular server (your own or a public site). the help below covers qa, input format/structures, and advice about downsampling as needed. also, keep in mind that some plant genomes can be quite complicated to assemble for biological reasons, and can require more resources (especially memory). some will require employing advanced assembly methods. much discussion about plant assembly and strategies can be found online with a few searches. issues around large genomes in general, and sub-features like high repetitive content lettuce), high ploidy content strawberry), large chromosomes (example: wheat) can all be factors to consider. but try the simple approach described below first, certainly cannot hurt. requirements/: reads must be in fastqsanger format (sanger phred+33 quality scores, what results from illumina 1.8+ sequencing) with that datatype assigned. if the data is in compressed fastqsanger.gz format, uncompressed versions of the inputs will be created as hidden datasets. this can unexpectedly increase quota usage. sometimes uploading uncompressed fastq can be a better choice – it depends on the tools you plan to use – some work with compressed fastq and some do not (but galaxy will ""manage"" that for you). just something to be aware of. load reads by url or with ftp. if ""autodetect"" for datatype assignment is used, fastqsanger will be assigned automatically if the reads are actually in that format. if you get a different autodetected datatype, there is an input problem that needs to be addressed first fastqillumia== needs quality score rescaling or just fastq == probably a format issue). note: if you decide to upload and directly assign fastqsanger.gz to preserve compression, you should definitely run the qa steps to verify that datatype is assigned correctly, or expect problems (assembly jobs failing due to unexpected quality score scaling will look like any other memory failure, and require that you have to back up to the start, run qa, and fix the reads if that is the actual issue). if the data is actually uncompressed and assigned that datatype, any tool can also fail, and most but not all will report what the problem is. fastqc will guess the quality score scaling. that can be compared with the specific datatypes. see the support faqs to learn how to interpret the report and how to convert to fastqsanger if needed (tool: ""fastq groomer`). punch line: it is more satisfying/less frustrating to get the inputs correct at the start, so you do not need to hunt for basic issues later on, possibly after much other work is already done. no one likes to ""start over"". run some qa on your reads. fastqc followed by multiqc summarize the raw fastqc reports). running fastqc on the individual original datasets, in pairs (r1+r2) will be more informative. this can be run in batch or by using dataset collection(s), if wanted. next, run trimmomatic if adaptor or low-quality ends are reported by fastqc. you may want to run this anyway to get your reads paired up and catch content issues not found by fastqc (only checks a subset of the data, first 200k reads or so, and can be biased). there will be four outputs per paired-end input. two will be the reads that are still paired after qa. this is important trinity requires paired-end fastq inputs to be in intact pairs tends to run better fail for resource reasons) with cleaned-up reads. use concatenate to merge all r1 reads into one dataset and all r2 (reverse) reads into another. two distinct runs. if the trinity run fails for exceeding resources, then subsampling your reads can help. you may decide to do this per-pair or after concatenating (after qa is done) – your choice. see the seqtk tools: seqtk_sample or seqtk_seq are good choices. the first is a specific function, the latter more comprehensive with that function included. in most cases, you will need to run the tool twice (once to output r1 forward reads, once to output r2 reverse reads). be conservative first, to preserve as much of the original data as possible, then move to more restrictive as needed. if the data will not assemble at all then one of these is going on: a) some input problem is present, b) not enough qa was done, c) the data exceeds processing needs that a public galaxy server, or your own, has allocated. public resources are fixed for most tools, including trinity. a cloud galaxy may be more appropriate. be aware that if you combined the data into a dataset collection forward collection r2 reverse collection, or in an r1+r2 paired-end collection) at the start, you will need to use collection operations tools to manipulate the read data to fit the tools (example: collapse collection will perform the same manipulation as concatenate). see the dataset collection ""collection operations"" tutorials linked below to understand how to work with collections. help is also on the tool forms. with so many inputs, collections will be very useful, but also a bit trickier to use if you have not tried them yet. that said, these are definitely worth learning how to use, now or later. often a mix of paired-end and single-end collections, used at different steps, is needed to work through an analysis. tutorials support faqs related: gtn tutorials: @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/ (all) start with those in the groups ""assembly"", ""transcriptomics"", and (collection manipulations are covered). support faqs: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/#troubleshooting start with the first few in ""unexpected results"" and ""getting inputs right"" to understand format, datatypes, error messages (and what to do about each!), etc. see ""loading data"" if you are not sure how to use ftp (usually only needed with slower internet connections, but is fast/simple for batch uploads too). fastqc is covered in many tutorials, but reading the tool's faqs about specific statistics reported is informative, see: @link https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/

[INST] i am currently doing my project work on exome sequencing and is using the following tutorial (exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease). i have an error in gemini load tool. it is showing that the vcf format is unavailable(snpeff eff). please look into the problem and help me with it. thank you galaxy - google chrome (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/d/df2fb2eff7e07cd44ec2a618e25e052c1b4855ab.png) galaxy - google chrome (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/a/aa189bd231c5dd2801928e62acdf2088566df6bc.png) [/INST] yes, the gemini load tool produces a gemini database, which is not intended to be viewed, but queried. please follow the tutorial, which explains a few ways how you can do that. these tutorials: identification of somatic and germline variants from tumor and normal sample pairs (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/somatic-variants/tutorial.html) and calling variants in diploid systems (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/dip/tutorial.html) demonstrate more options. think of the gemini database as a computer-friendly version of a vcf. you cannot read it, but queries are very efficient. the gemini load tool is essentially the converter that takes vcf and produces the database format.

[INST] i have a problem when trying to get genomic dna sequences from a list of genomic coordinates. the file contains regions aroung chip-seq peaks and has been obtained trough several galaxy functions (map with bowtie, macs2 callpeak, compute and cut). it is correctly formatted (as .interval, but i have also tried as .bed) with columns corresponding to chr start end name and its genome version is indicated: [format:interval database:mm9]. when i apply the function genomic dna using coordinates from assembled/unassembled genomes"" selecting mm9 from the locally cached genomes i get an empty file with this warning: warnings, 1st is: chromosome by name was not found for build 'mm9'. skipped 622 invalid lines, 1st is #1, ""chr19 3204403 3204904 sam-to-bam_on_data_7__converted_bam_peak_1"". i get the same when i try to redo the analysis selecting mm10 instead of mm9. note that in https://usegalaxy.org/ there are two instances of ""extract genomic dna using coordinates from assembled/unassembled genomes"", one is version 3.0.3 (the same available in https://usegalaxy.eu/) but there is also a version 2.2.4 which works perfectly fine on the same file above and it returns the correct fasta file with all the sequences. moreover, in https://usegalaxy.org/ the version 3.0.3 of ""extract genomic dna using coordinates from assembled/unassembled genomes"" does not even display mm9 among the available cached genomes (even if i do the entire pipeline including mapping). i need to perform this step on @link https://usegalaxy.eu/, can you help me with this? best, mattia [/INST] , this should now be fixed on @link http://usegalaxy.eu. , bjoern

[INST] hello there! i am working with wgbs data and i want to extract the dmrs in a particular mutant. i used bwameth to align the sequencing data to mm10 genome. after that, i sorted the alignment file and used methyldackel to see the methylation status. i used the metilene tool to extract dmrs but this does not work. i get an error message like this null device 1 tue aug 9, 16:7:8, 2022 input files need to be sorted, i.e., use ""bedtools sort file file.sorted"". i sorted the methyldackel output files using sortbed and ran metilene again. same error message. i read from the manual for metilene, that the input file has to be in a certain format and the input file can be prepared using bedtools unionbedg. but this tool is not present in @link http://usegalaxy.eu or .org. can anyone help me to prepare the input files for metilene? thanks!! abishek [/INST] thanks for asking! yes i did, by removing the last two columns and first row (description) of the methyldackel output. it then did the trick and metilene took them with no problem! the weird thing is that i did not have this problem at all a year ago when i used the exact same files and process (using it for teaching a course). clément

[INST] dear all, i am discovering the galaxy world and i try to integrate some tools to galaxy. i started with https://sites.google.com/view/recentrifuge a tool for taxonomy visualization but i failed to generate the output. in fact, the planemo test failed to compare because the output of the test is empty. the recentrifuge code do not explicit an output but i tried with the -o option (give another name to the output) without success. so i do not know how to deal to solve the no output problem. as a minimal example with only my input file, output files and test code : <![cdata[ mkdir '$__tool_directory__/output_dir' rcf '$db.cached_db.fields.path' #end if #if $file_type.filetype == '$input_file' #else if $file_type.filetype == '$input_file' #else if $file_type.filetype == '$input_file' #else if $file_type.filetype == '$input_file' #end if #if '$output_name.modify_name' == '$__tool_directory__/output_dir/$output_name.file_name' #else -o #end if -e '$output_type']]> output_type and ""csv"" in output_type output_type and ""tsv"" in output_type output_type and ""tsv"" in output_type output_type and ""xlsx"" in output_type or output_type and ""dynomics"" in output_type output_type and ""csv"" in output_type or output_type and ""multicsv"" in output_type the planemo report give me the code seem to be ok : mkdir '/home/pierre/.planemo/planemo_tmp_a_v6y1k9/output_dir' rcf -n '/home/pierre/.planemo/planemo_tmp_a_v6y1k9/test-data/test-db' -k '/tmp/tmpnivasmvl/files/2/3/3/dataset_2334d82b-ddc1-4dc8-bb41-df026f8c1a34.dat' -o 'csv' the standard ouput from planemo report is okay, the softaware indicate generating of files and give me the output directory generating final plot ok! generating csv extra output ok! [/INST] , i opened a pr; it fixes the problem with the outputs fix outputs by gallardoalba pull request #1 mesocentre-clermont-auvergne/galaxy-tools github (@link https://github.com/mesocentre-clermont-auvergne/galaxy-tools/pull/1/) regards

[INST] hello, using galaxy for the first time on aws through the genomics virtual lab on cloudlaunch. i understand that i cannot use the same username as when i use the public servers but my question is, how do i then use a workflow? i want to be able to have a workflow i can run every time i run galaxy on aws but it seems that it creates a new blank server every time with no way to save a workflow for next time. is this way of using galaxy only for exploratory analysis? thanks [/INST] try downloading a copy of your workflow from @link http://usegalaxy.org. it will be in a file that ends with the extension .ga. that can then be uploaded to the cloud server into your new account. the first time you open the workflow in the editor, warnings will come up if any tools/tool version are a mismatch for what is already installed on the default server. you can update tools in the workflow, install new tools on the server, etc until things match up. installing new tool indexes is also possible. once you have customized your cloud server (if you need to), you can save an ami image for reuse. this will cost money to maintain, so if you decide to do this, keeping the image as small as possible would be a good idea (save a copy that does not include full analysis, just what you need to start up a new analysis permanently delete non-reusable account data, etc). workflow objects themselves use up very little space, so you could keep yours in the ami. or, download a copy of the workflow configured to work with the gvl default install or your custom ami. saving a backup copy is good idea anyway.

[INST] my account were active last night and running data, however this morning i tried logging in to find a message saying the account had been marked as deleted. how do i recover the data that was in the account? [/INST] update nov 1, 2019 duplicated accounts are detected as an ongoing process. if you found your account recently deleted, or have not but do have duplicates and want to avoid problems, write to us at mailto:galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org and list the following: the registered email for the account you wish to keep if that email is from a public domain service, include your non-public primary email address. see ""reminders"" below if you do not understand the difference. list out your duplicated account email addresses. all, not just those you happen to be using right now. confirm that you now understand the terms of usage, and will follow them going forward. reminders: only one account will ever be restored. unfair usage means data loss in other accounts. terms of usage can be found here: @link https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html there is never a valid reason for multiple accounts if we discover duplicated accounts before they are proactively declared, your data is at risk of being lost a public domain email address is from an anonymous service like gmail, hotmail, nate, qq, yahoo or similar. a non-public primary email address is from your university or place of work. act quickly and be honest. account terms are only re-clarified once per user, as a courtesy. read this faq: getting an account at galaxy main (http://usegalaxy.org) https://galaxyproject.org/support/account/) creating a ""new"" account will not solve duplicated account problems and instead because more. you need to write in to get your issues resolved, correctly. the simplified quota rule is one account per user per public galaxy server. end users are permitted to create a single account at each other public galaxy server — most if not all have a ""one account per end-user"" requirement. when presented with the activation link in the emails anyone received when creating an account, the account terms were very clearly explained, and you agreed to these terms. quote: by clicking on the above link and opening a galaxy account, you are also confirming that you have read and agreed to galaxy's terms and conditions for the use of this service (@link https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html). terms include a quota limit of one account per user. attempts to subvert this limit by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in the termination of all associated accounts and data. thanks for understanding and for helping us to keep galaxy a free and fair public resource, for everyone, worldwide. jen the galaxy team

[INST] hi everyone, i am currently analyzing rnaseq data obtained from dog cell culture. i used hisat2 for the alignment to the canis familiaris reference genome in galaxy. then, to count the reads, i tried both htseq-count version 0.9.1) and featurecounts (galaxy version 1.6.4+galaxy1). as gene annotation file, i took this file from igenomes: @link https://usegalaxy.eu/library/list#folders/fcf0661b18aa5ad51 it contains 32461 lines, among them 15178 exons (feature type). as i run htseq-count/featurecounts with 'exon' as feature type, i expected 15178 lines in the outout of these tools. in contrast, i get both in htseq-count and featurecounts only 2023 lines, even though exons with 0 counts are included in the output. do you have any idea what could have happened to the remaining exons? thank you. best hannah [/INST] the igenomes version of the annotation is based on refseq from several years ago. annotation from ensembl will be more current but will require some manipulations to have the chromosome identifiers match up with the built-in canfam3 indexes that are sourced from ucsc. or, you can also use the matching ensembl fasta version of the genome and use that as a custom reference genome/build with tools. be aware that the dog genome is very large and may exceed server processing resources when used this way at a public galaxy server. but you can try. do not assign the ""database"" as canfam3 if you decide to use all ensembl data. you will also need to remap. the ensembl version of the data does not have the same chromosome identifiers as the ucsc version. every step in an analysis needs to use data that is all based on the same exact genome/build. faqs: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/ preparing and using a custom reference genome or build (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/custom-genomes/) mismatched chromosome identifiers (and how to avoid them) (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/chrom-identifiers/) the tool i am using does not recognize any input datasets. why? https://galaxyproject.org/support/datatypes-and-tools/) how do i find, adjust, and/or correct metadata?

[INST] i am doing an rna seq analysis and after aligning with star and filtering after deseq2 a question remains. and that is:how to replace these id with official gene names? i found a tool names annotatedmyids but it is not working [/INST] hi - since the identifier is in the first column, text transformation with sed will work without a complex expression. try this: s/\.[0-9]+// other options include using regular expressions with tools like: text reformatting with awk replace parts of text replace text in entire line replace text in a specific column or, if you do not want to use a regular expression, the column can be isolated, the ""dot"" replaced with a ""tab"", then all the data rearranged back again into one file. this could be put into a workflow if you plan to run it again. example tool order: cut convert delimiters to tab paste cut. also, your ids are emsembl transcripts, so choose that as the input type with annotatemyids. hope that helps!

[INST] i have a local galaxy installation that so far works fine. i now work with data collections. i have illumina data files) in one collection (each file around 20-30 mb, so not very big). i now try to run jobs on that collection. for example fastqc. now galaxy behaves strange: when i select the collection as fastqc input and press ""submit"", galaxy starts to add the jobs into the history while the button is shown at the tool page so, i do not see the green page yet. however, after approx. 60 sec. galaxy starts to submit the job again (while the button is still showing). the ""old"" job keeps being processed - it just adds a new one (with of course again 128 entries. after some time (~60sec) it adds it again and so on. this can easily add 10 jobs with over 1000 files from my inital list - that are of course all processed. this strange behavior only stops at some point when galaxy displays an error message saying the ""the job submission failed"" (red box). from then on no ""new"" jobs are added. the thing is that even the first job submission was ok - it just needed some time to be processed due to the large number of files. to me this looks like a timeout error that is triggered because the tool page is at the level for to long. is there any way how i can increase such a timeout to prevent this ""explosion"" of jobs? many thanks in advance! for any help! [/INST] if your using nginx as your proxy and you connect via the uwsgi protocol you can increase the timeout by setting uwsgi_read_timeout 300; which would set the timeout to 5 minutes. if you are using uwsgi without a proxy you should be able to set http-timeout: 300 in the uwsgi: section of galaxy.yml (you can find all valid options for uwsgi in @link https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options.html#http-timeout), but i am less certain about that being the right option.

[/INST] we assume and highly recommend that jobs submitted by galaxy are run on a hpc system with a job scheduler (like slurm, pbs, torque, lsf) or kubernetes. you then configure the destinations in the job_conf.xml file to request the required resources, and you assign tools to the destination. if you do not have this available you can use local_slots as you found out, but you still need to map tools to destinations. note that this is not recommended, as there is no way for galaxy to know what resources are available, so you will start consuming more resources than are available if you queue up many jobs. connecting galaxy to a compute cluster (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/connect-to-compute-cluster/tutorial.html) walks through installing slurm using ansible on the head node while that is still not ideal it is better than using the local job runner.

[/INST] welcome, @user the column set for the score column is not appropriate for files from macs2. expand your dataset to find the correct column, probably c5, unless you manipulated the files? the galaxy version of the tool requires sample replicates. quote from the tool form down in the help section, sometimes missed. note this diffbind tool requires a minimum of four samples (two groups with two replicates each). if you want to do ""data exploration"" with only two samples, that might be possible with the command-line version of this tool. but check before you invest time in that some of the other tools by the same authors had changes that require the use of replicates now, too, at the source (so impact command-line versions). all bioconductor tools wrapped for galaxy have always required replicates. three replicates per condition is the minimum ideal for scientific reasons but two is enough to satisfy the technical requirements. bioconductor forum (@link https://support.bioconductor.org/post/search/?query=diffbind) my control (wt) and treated samples was not assigned properly for differential analysis. under the replicate column, diffbind calls wt and 3xtg as replicate 1,2,3,4 instead of replicate 1,2 for both conditions (as shown in the attached picture 1). in addition, under the caller column, it shows as raw instead of bed. i have included narrowpeak bed file called from macs as well as the bam files (shown in picture 2). all of this is due to how the underlying tool is creating data structures in r. your screenshot of the input design from the dataset details view explains how the data is logically input to this tool, and is correct. the issue is with missing replicates – in this view that would show up as two datasets in each section, and is the same as how you would input the data on the tool form. the order per group matters for the peak-bam pairings but do not worry about that yet. if you get a job failure once inputting replicates, you can read about this in the help section and reorder the datasets in the history dataset new history, done in the order that you want the tool to use them). or, bundle and process the samples within collections, and this ""order"" will work out automatically and not be as tedious. the good news: this is only tool with that ""dataset order in the history"" wrinkle and it is because of the pairing of the inputs. there was not another good way to model the data back when the wrapper was written. you job did not have replicates yet so the pairings were fine. resources @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=collections @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=chip-seq – note this tool is not specifically covered but other related tools are and the usage is similar search results for order:likes' - galaxy community help (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/search?q=diffbind%20order%3alikes)

[INST] hello everyone, i am using galaxy to trim and align data from targeted dna-seq. using bwa-mem i have seen that between built-in genomes there is not the hg38 canonical you can find in bowtie2. how is it possible to use that genome version to assembly my data? thank you in advantage., g. [/INST] ah, yes, you are right (sorry for not reading the question carefully the first time). hg38 should be identical to hg38 full, but it is different from hg38 canonical. so, no, you cannot use hg38 canonical as the reference in a bwa-mem alignment. that said, you should also not do that anyway. aligning against just canonical chromosomes can cause misalignments of reads that originate from non-canonical sequences, simply because there is no better match for them than a stretch of canonical sequence. the better approach is to align against the full genome, then eliminate non-canonical mappings by filtering or by using the canonical genome during variant calling. agreed, this can be tricky depending on downstream tools. some variant callers, for example, may refuse to work with sequences mentioned in the input bam header that are not found in the reference genome, in which case you would have to reheader your bam dataset first. all in all, my recommendation would be to rerun your bowtie2 jobs using the full hg38 version, not to look for solutions for making bwa-mem work with the canonical version. at the same time, it is probably true that we should offer hg38 canonical for bwa-mem if we do so for bowtie2 so thanks for bringing this up.

[INST] i have 24 untrimmed fastq files for rna-seq. they are paired files. i have them in a data collection and run fastqc on them with no problem, but when i try to aggregate fastqc results with multiqc it only reports two files; forward and reverse, instead of each of the 24 individual files. what i am i doing wrong? i have followed the tutorials and have set all parameters per those tutorials but keep getting the same result. [/INST] try ""flatten collection"" from collection operation section on collection of paired reads before the fastqc step. datasets in flatten collection have unique names. hope this helps. , igor

[INST] hi all, i am working on galaxy and have a genome file in genbank format. to use featurecounts for my rnaseq, i need to convert the genbank format to a gtf format because that is the format the featurecounts tool in galaxy expects. now, i tried to convert thse genbank to gff3 using genbaktogff3 tool in galaxy and managed to do so. also i tried to use the gffread tool to convert the gff3 file to gtf but this resulted in a gtf with no written lines and i cannot understand why. is there a way to directly convert genbank to gtf in galaxy even outside galaxy, but preferably in galaxy). also, any idea why gffread is not working properly in my case? i am using default parameters (leaving everything as is) and only giving gtf as feature file output and track name as ""word"". thanks, [/INST] , it seems that this problem has been fixed recently, but the new tool version is not available in http://usegalaxy.org yet; i have requested to update it; meanwhile, i suggest yo use @link http://usegalaxy.eu, since gffread works fine in that instance. regards

[INST] dear all, apologies to bother you again. another salmon quant question. while checking the output files, i noticed that the number of lines in the output files (""gene quantification"" and ""quantification"") was inconsistent. for instance: image image i understand that quantification"" vs output files show different things (@link https://biostar.galaxyproject.org/p/28404/): one the counts for genes while the other for transcripts. while that could possibly explain different numbers of rows, i am somewhat puzzled by higher numbers of lines in the quantification"" file - i would expect more transcripts (and their versions) than genes. also, some files have the same number of lines: ~190,000. second thing, when i was trying to set-up the pipeline for my analysis and ran deseq2, the pca spaced the datasets a bit weirdly: i expected them to group by test condition but they did not. of course, sample size was too small for pca (only 4 datasets in total) but having noticed this difference in line numbers, i now began to worry that maybe i ended up incorrectly or partially mapping/aligning/referencing the datasets and/or maybe they are partially counted by salmon and/or partially compared when running deseq2. third concerning thing was that my transcript-to-gene table i tried when testing the pipeline earlier had ~270,000 lines (probably because of transcript versions). i dropped that when deseq2 did not work and switched to ensembl cdna reference in format (~3,200,000 lines). problem is, i did not notice this issue with differences in numbers of lines when running the pilots (they were all ~190,000 lines, irrespective of which dataset or output file it was). and i am sure i used the same parameters for all the datasets - pilot and the remaining ones. would appreciate your opinion on whether this is a problem and if so, how you would recommend to solve it. thanks! [/INST] @quote the interesting thing is that the second thread also mentions some mismatches between the fasta and files. is this something you have ever run into when doing your analyses? this is likely your problem, too. and many posts at this forum are about format/content issues with either fasta, gtf, or both when used together. tools are literal any identifier that is compared between files needs to exactly match between all inputs. short list of absolute requirements for salmon deseq2 transcript fasta did the file completely upload to galaxy? truncated fasta is very hard to detect. so, just try to reproduce it by loading the file again and comparing has correct formatting – try running it through the tool normalizefasta using the options to wrap at 80 bases and checking the box to remove ""everything after the first whitespace"" does not contain any duplicated transcripts_id values – these are on the title lines if you get the fasta from a data provider, all in one file, it might have problems the first and second will address but you will not need to worry about third gtf should be from the same data provider where you sourced the fasta make sure it is also completed uploaded, and use ""auto-detect"" for the datatype. if galaxy does not guess gtf there is a problem to fix the most common problem is header lines # at the top. remove the headers, then ""redetect"" the datatype until galaxy guesses gtf. if it will not be produced, then you do not have a gtf (maybe is gff3 which will not work well?) inspect the identifiers in that file – does the transcript_id attribute exactly match those in the fasta (minus the)? does the file contain gene_id attributes? are those different from the transcript_id attributes? if they are the same value, you need to find a gtf that has actual gene_id values. execute all salmon runs with the same fasta, along with the same gtf that you plan to use with deseq2. these faqs cover the ""how-to"". the ucsc hosted ensembl genes track is probably what you want to use. get the fasta from the table browser but get the gtf from their downloads area (only – not the tb). @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#working-with-very-large-fasta-datasets @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#working-with-gff-gft-gtf2-gff3-reference-annotation @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#detecting-the-datatype-file-format i also added some tags to your post that will find related prior topics here.

[INST] is it possible to use have workflow 'inputs' that allow multiple sample selection? e.g. first step of 'workflow a' uses starsolo, which allows selection of multiple lanes. both r1 files (and both r2) are handled by a single run of the tool (rather than a batch job run twice). image if i set it up with datasets' upon running the pipeline i can select either a single input from a dropdown, or, hit 'multiple datasets' which creates a batch job. is a batch mode input field. separate jobs will be triggered for each dataset selection.""). neither of which is what i want. image if, instead, i leave the inputs out as so: image i get the full version of the inputs rather than the nice parameterised summary (its petty, but this matters to me, i am trying to make it nice for useability), but i can select the multiple files to run correctly. image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/7/7764afad298fd33ab2714b30e698ab5996f53d03.jpeg) however, that has knockon effects. my ""workflow a"" is essentially a subworkflow to be called by ""workflow b"". in workflow b, i cannot connect any input to the r1/r2 inputs of workflow a, so when i launch it there is no box for this input. if i hit 'expland to full workflow form', right now* i cannot see any further options to expland inputs for this subworkflow. image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/2/227969f26830835a7fbe2f026e9996996448c73b.png) i thought i had previously seen this to give the dropdown' or batch selection options(so unable to run correctly), but that might have been when i had the subworkflow a set to take an 'input'. i am a fairly new galaxy user, so understand i might not be coming at this from the right angle. what is the ~galaxy-way~ tm of structuring this kind of input? [/INST] @quote so i changed the input type in my workflow too. and then created a 'collection input' (from the inputs menu). by default, it would not let me connect via noodle (fair, it needs a collection of pairs). so i changed the type in the collection to 'list:paired', and then i could noodle that into the starsolo input. for this part, when changing the input type, disconnecting all the downstream noodles, then reconnecting in the order of processing will ""reset"" the workflow metadata. i am not sure if that was what you did. if not yet, try that first. it solves many workflow-runtime issues. @quote but if i configure this in my workflow as below, i get two independant starsolo runs, one per lane. if still a problem after reconnecting the noodles and trying a rerun, would you please post back a screenshot of the setting you want to use on the tool form? the one you want translated into the workflow? and maybe the section of that same tool form within your workflow (the side panel)? sort of what you posted originally. these visually provide a lot of useful information :slight_smile: i do not think this tool ""pools"" samples but let us make sure.

[INST] hi i have a similar problem. when i am adding a control bam file to my sequence i am getting 0 narrow peaks and 0 bed. when i do not have a control i am getting the results. could you please help me? [/INST] this comment makes me think that the person who reviewed the data thought it was too sparse to call peaks, so they suggested less aggressive filtering. that is certainly something to try, but all of this is a balance. if you tried something like filtering only the control at 30 (strict), and treatments at 10 (permissive), that may even produce results, but the scientific quality of the result would be questionable, and in a different way than not including a control at all already did produce questionable results for one of you). @quote i have had mapq of 30 before but changed it according to the bioinformatician's recommendation at uni. i did not get any results with mapq 30 either. if there is a suspected data content problem, these are the items to examine: run fastqc https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html) on the reads before and after other qa is applied (trimming, etc) and review if the data does not appear to have sufficient quality it may not be usable review the bam mapping rates this is likely where the problem first starts to impact the analysis, i am guessing low coverage review the bam alignments in a genome browser (details in original post + consider adding in an annotation gtf ucsc has several for each mouse build in galaxy) try different filtering methods: mapq is not the only item, getting rid of optical duplicates is also important (also in original post, plus see protocol advice at other forums – one example did you remove chip-seq duplicates (@link https://www.biostars.org/p/318974/)) use the most current version of the genome build for the species (mm10, not mm9) and, sometimes using a mapper like blastn+, with a subset of reads as a query against a target database that contains reads from many species (wgs) can give some information: are the reads really from the species you think they were originally from? is there contamination of some type? other items like checking that the control and treatment samples are not mixed up is part of this. get the processed reads from archives like sra, and not the submitted reads, unless you understand how to manipulate the submitted reads into the current illumina format that most tools know how to interpret. the processed fastq reads from sra are already in the right format (fastqsanger). you can test this by allowing galaxy to guess the format https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#datatypes) and also by running fastqc after the data is loaded (the format is reported). not all public datasets are high quality, and that can impact the ability to use reads for analysis. reads that you created yourself or obtained from a collaborator could also have quality/usability problems. this is a judgement call on your part, and the help above and in the original post are the ways to explore data for quality/performance with tools leading up to the problems with macs2. small note: the @link http://usegalaxy.org server is undergoing maintenance. i would not expect the problem in the history i reviewed to be impacted – but this can double checked by running the same analysis at a different usegalaxy.* server: @link http://usegalaxy.eu or @link http://usegalaxy.org.au.

[INST] hi, i have an existing dataset from nanopore run in fast5 format. i am using galaxy to convert it into fastq format. the tools which i have trialled from the tools list are: 1) extract fastq in tabular format from a set of fast5 files and 2) extract read in fasta or fastq format from nanopore files. i got either 1 line or 0 bytes from these runs,no output. does anyone has any idea why? or which step did i miss or input the wrong thing? thank you. [/INST] this error indicates that a tar archive was loaded and used for the input. for many cases when a tar archive is uploaded, only the first file in the archive is loaded. that first file can be an index, which will not contain any reads. these tools are working at http://usegalaxy.org using the tool's test data data url link (@link https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/blob/master/tools/poretools/test-data/poretools-in1.tar.bz2?raw=true)). review to see if/how your input dataset differs and make adjustments as needed. the input was directly loaded by url with the datatype galaxy | accessible history nanopore tar upload test (@link https://usegalaxy.org/you/jen-galaxyproject/h/nanopore-tar-upload-test) if you get odd results again after adjusting the input needed), or if you cannot figure out what adjustments are even needed, please write back and specify: which public galaxy server you are working at url)? the topic was posted under the http://usegalaxy.org category, but sometimes that is misassigned. or, if using a different type of galaxy deployment, please describe. galaxy version, how/where sourced and installed, and the last date it was updated. update your own galaxy if needed. there are point-updates between full releases – and those are usually important to capture (tend to be bug fixes important enough to include before the next full release) releases — galaxy project 20.09 documentation https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/index.html). please be aware that the next full release is expected to be published in the next week or so (if all goes as planned!). the pre-release 21.01 is already installed at http://usegalaxy.org for integration testing – but do not install that version yet on your own server. how and from where tools were installed also matters. the most current version should be sourced from the galaxy main toolshed https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/. install directly from the admin area of the galaxy application and use the built-in dependency resolution function for the simplest way to make sure the install is complete. what is the currently assigned to the dataset when the tools failed to produce output? was that autodetected during upload? or did you assign it directly? what datatype is assigned if you try to ""detect datatype"" under the function: pencil icon edit attributes datatypes? does a rerun work with that datatype assigned (if it differs)? let us start troubleshooting more from there :slight_smile:. we may ask for you to generate a share link to the history containing the work so we can review it in more detail and provide the best feedback. that can be posted into a branched direct message (we will start one up – as you will not be able to yet since are new to this forum) – unless you are ok with posting the share link publically in a reply to this topic. thanks!

[INST] hello! i have to fill parameters manually into my workflow which are mostly file names and sample names. i have to select from about 7 files about 20 times and enter similar but slightly different sample names (e. g. wn0552.a7ce75785, wn0552.a7ce75785_tumor, wn0552.a7ce75785_normal) for another 20 times. as you may guess, it is time consuming, error prone and in general not exactly the kind of work i dreamed of. but i suspect i can automate this process. if it were linux command line, all i need were echo, cat, ln etc., and some rarely used ascii symbols. however in galaxy i found only cat. so essentially i want: tool that receives one file and sends it to the output intact so i could connect its output to all steps using some specific file and set its name only once. in linux it may be cat or cp, but i would prefer ln or even variable definition to save disk space and time. tool that receives some string and output it intact like echo. tool that receives two string and concatenates them like echo so i could set my sample name to e. g. wn0552.a7ce75785, derive other important strings from it and use these strings in all my steps using ""add connection to module"". and also tool that gives the number of processors on current machine to set the number of threads in some tools. is this possible in galaxy? or maybe there is an easier way to automate workflows? or i have to write wrappers for all these tools myself? thanks in advance.

[INST] greetings! i want to study ribosomal rna expression and potential processing sites in bacteria. to such effect, i want to perform an rna-seq experiment in order to analyze potential rrna transcripts isoforms and processing sites. conventional rna-seq experiments are not designed for the analysis of rrna expression and generally include a rna depletion step, which reduces rrna signal. notice rrna in bacteria accounts for ~90% of total rna. in the context of studying rrna processing, would the rna-seq approach be appropriate? if so, what rrna treatment would you recommend to study rrna expression levels and processing?"" thank you in advance. [/INST] sorry @user, i did not express it properly; the cited protocol can be used for extracting total rna, not just rrna. any protocol for rna extraction will be fine.

[INST] hello, we are trying to analyze our files following this rna seq tutorial: @link https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/nt_rnaseq/ our deseq2 outputs, however, are giving us mstrg gene ids, which are not very useful as the labels are only relevant internally. in researching how to convert mstrg to a gene name, we found that a better ""reference file to guide assembly"" should be used to run stringtie so a gene name is outputted. however, the galaxy stringtie job fails when we use the homo_sapiens_ncbi_grch38.tar.gz reference file. we have tried unzipping it to .tar and also using a dexseq annotation as the reference file, then ran stringtie, but this also failed. also, the option to use a built in reference file is disabled. currently, the only method that successfully outputs a deseq2 file is when no reference file is used, however we are unsure how to convert the mstrg gene id it outputs to a gene name/prevent mstrg outputs. any help is greatly appreciated; thanks in advance! -preformatted textananya [/INST] sorry the original question got missed. this faq explains how/where to get a human reference annotation dataset that will work with these tools: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/different-expression/ i also added some tags to your post that includes other qa about this. in short, you need a gtf dataset that matches the ucsc version of the genome/build (if you are mapping against the built-in genome indexes). correct format matters or tools will fail. the faq and linked faqs explain with full details and common sources. grch38 is the same genome as ucsc's hg38. grch37 is the same genome as ucsc's hg19. but the ""build"" may differ between sources. check your chromosome identifiers and make sure they are a match. thanks!

[INST] hi, all there, i am trying to build a local galaxy that anybody can access with different devices on the same internet, so i set the uwsgi part of galaxy.yml as 'http: 127.0.0.1:8080', then it showed : ##################################### galaxy server instance 'main.web.1' is running starting server in pid 9063. serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080 ##################################### but with this setting, we could not access galaxy from the web browser on any other pc. could you give me some advice on how to set of my galaxy or linux environment? [/INST] generally your computer has to be reachable over the network for the other devices to be able to see your services like galaxy. that means it has to have an ip address that the others know and can send requests too. this is very much out of scope of what galaxy community can help you with since we have no knowledge of your network's topology. i recommend you contact your network administrator and ask for help.

[INST] please note that i have already posted this message below since october 20 at the http://usegalaxy.org support, but so far i got no response. thus, i am reposting it here in case someone could help. many thanks in advance. initial post in http://usegalaxy.org support: hello, i am using as input for the volcano plot tool a file derived from deseq2. the whole pipeline works great and i do get the corresponding valcano graph but i have two little issues: few genes are highly expressed and at the same time have p-value equal to 0; thus, these genes are depicted in the corresponding volcano at the very top: image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/f/fb0b8c45e836a35598384834125edcf4b81401ba.png) my question is: how should i treat those genes? i definitely want to have them due to are highly expressed, but at the same time, the plot doesn`t look proper in the way they are presented. i am not saying that is wrong, just saying that is odd. should i exclude those genes? should i do anything else with them? on some occasions the deseq2 file that i am using as an input does show for logfc, p-value, and p-adjust of a few genes the entry na, i guess standing for not applicable, instead of any real value. should i exclude these particular genes from the input that i am going to use for the volcano? i will highly appreciate any help, greetings [/INST] update i can reproduce your graph clumping up near the top by faking extremely small p-values (e100, e200, e300, e400 e900). it seems this is a known limitation of r data representation - r largest/smallest representable numbers - stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38165221/r-largest-smallest-representable-numbers) and the bioconductor tool authors are aware, example topic older posts!) p value of 0? (@link https://support.bioconductor.org/p/64787/) but you can also search there for how others have scientifically interpreted these tiny values and any current additional advice. galaxy history that uses the inputs and workflow from the tutorial, plus an adjusted input with ""extreme-pvalues"" for the test. everything is tagged and i will leave it shared as a reference. galaxy | accessible history | test rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot https://usegalaxy.org/you/jen/h/test-rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot) hope that helps! @quote that tool/step had a problem interpreting the content of the values evaluated. it looks like you are losing significant digits in the table (excel?). @quote a p-value of 0 should be filtered out for not being significant. tools can report all kinds of odd values when there is a problem. a pvalue that is actually just ""0"" means that something went wrong. in your case, this seems to be related to losing significant digits in intermediate applications and that should be addressed. try running these tools in galaxy if you are not already, and see what results. you will not lose significant digits.

[INST] hello everyone! which appliance on galaxy would you recomend for eukaryotic genomic annotation? it would be even more helpful if there was one capable of intersecting or cross-linking information from two or more exomes. the galaxy tutorials used gemini and funannotate but those appear to no longer be availiable. thank you in advance, anna [/INST] i believe if you intersect annotated vcf files, the output file will have the annotations present in the input file(s). galaxy servers usually have several intersection tools. maybe try different tools. , igor

[/INST] hi all – if you are working at http://usegalaxy.org, there is one very busy cluster. a new banner on the server explains: tools impacted include by the busiest cluster: unicycler, spades, and trinity other clusters that run different tools are also very busy. leave jobs queued for the quickest processing and to not lose your place in the queue. three hours is not very long to wait give it a few days – most jobs will process sooner than that, but the queue time is dependent on the server load as @system stated. the above applies to jobs that have valid inputs. it may be worth checking those upstream inputs for problems. if any are in an error or paused state, that could lead to downstream jobs pausing until the input is corrected – if you need to make a change to an input, that would be the exception for waiting. you should correct the inputs, then rerun. faqs: galaxy support (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/) datasets and how jobs execute (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/how-jobs-execute/) extended help for differential expression analysis tools (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/different-expression/) note: when one public galaxy server is very busy, you can try working at another. http://usegalaxy.eu is one alternative. it is common to have one account at each distinct public galaxy server. each utilizes different processing resources. thanks!

[INST] we have been experiencing persistent error pasted below with our lab's cloud-based installation of the galaxy suite via the genomics virtual laboratory 4.4.0. specifically, whenever we attempt a trinity de novo assembly of a collection of illumina truseq stranded mrna paired end reads, we get the errors below. we have had no problems with these same data sets when using other tools like hisat2 and stringtie. we have poked around in the ""manage tools"" and ""manage dependencies"" area of the galaxy admin interface and updated to the latest version of trinity and checked dependencies, and all seems to be ok; however, we must confess to being rank amateurs. can anyone point us toward some other things we might try? fatal error: exit code 2 possible unintended interpolation of @2 in string at line 46. tool errors internal tool error log time phase file error 2019-02-14 03:03:05.105596 tool loading 2] no such file or directory: '/mnt/galaxy/galaxy-app/tool-data/sift_db.loc' 2019-02-14 03:03:05.104204 tool loading 2] no such file or directory: '/mnt/galaxy/galaxy-app/tool-data/add_scores.loc' 2019-02-14 03:03:05.103428 tool loading 2] no such file or directory: '/mnt/galaxy/galaxy-app/tool-data/codingsnps.loc' 2019-02-14 03:03:05.100147 tool loading also found additional error information via the galaxy | reports interface: error, 1 threads errored out at /mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity@2.8.4/opt/trinity-2.8.4/util/insilico_read_normalization.pl line 963. error, cmd: /mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity@2.8.4/opt/trinity-2.8.4/util/insilico_read_normalization.pl --seqtype fq --jm 1g --max_cov 200 --min_cov 1 --cpu 4 --output /mnt/galaxy/tmp/job_working_directory/000/104/working/trinity_out_dir/insilico_read_normalization --max_pct_stdev 10000 --ss_lib_type fr --left /mnt/galaxy/files/000/dataset_64.dat,/mnt/galaxy/files/000/dataset_67.dat,/mnt/galaxy/files/000/dataset_70.dat,/mnt/galaxy/files/000/dataset_73.dat --parallel_stats died with ret 6400 at line 2689. main::process_cmd(""/mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity\@2.8.4/opt""...) called at /mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity@2.8.4/bin/trinity line 3235 main::normalize(""/mnt/galaxy/tmp/job_working_directory/000/104/working/trinity""..., 200, array(0x55a0498484e8), array(0x55a0498484d0)) called at /mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity@2.8.4/bin/trinity line 3182 main::run_normalization(200, array(0x55a0498484e8), array(0x55a0498484d0)) called at /mnt/galaxy/tool_dependencies/_conda/envs/__trinity@2.8.4/bin/trinity line 1319 [/INST] this looks like a tool wrapper bug path quoting). it might present in some trinity tool wrapper versions and not in others. gvl 4.4.0 was released in september 2018 (@link https://galaxyproject.org/news/2018-09-28-gvl-440/) and is based on the galaxy release 18.05. the most current version of the trinity wrapper from the iuc was released in october 2018 (@link https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/trinity/c9cfec002f71). the most current galaxy version is now 19.01. i suggest updating the trinity wrapper to the most current iuc version and testing that out. if the latest version still presents with the problem, please write back and we can help to get a ticket opened to review the issue, learn the not guessed) root because, and get it fixed.

directory listing| [/INST] the service is definitely up. @quote faq:https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/ the faq has examples, but this is some more troubleshooting help that usually solves problems: make sure you are using the latest version of filezilla. the tool updates quite frequently and will prompt you to update when the app is opened. those updates install quickly. i tend to just replace my current version with the update – but i also do not set up any special configurations (on purpose) so i cannot tell you if those are preserved or not after an update with the latest version. you could test it out or review/ask for help from those app developers if this is a concern. there are many ftp clients, and it can be used command-line – the faq i sent has more help about that. try using all default settings. the connection will still be secure when connecting to @link http://usegalaxy.org. you will be prompted to accept the security certificate when the connection starts up. make sure to connect with your galaxy registered email address as your filezilla ""username"". your galaxy ""public name"" will not connect. the ""password"" is the same as used when logging into that same exact galaxy server for that same account. the ftp server name aka will vary by the galaxy server – sometimes it is the server's base url (and that is true for ""@link http://usegalaxy.org"") – and sometimes it is different. what to use is likely posted within the upload tool for the server in the button pop-up for the ftp function (tool used move ftp'd files into a history as datasets). another place to check is the server's homepage. if you cannot find it – you can ask here (we might know based on the public galaxy server's url) or you can contact those server administrators directly – not all follow this forum. contact information for public galaxy servers is often on the server's home page and/or in their directory listing here: https://galaxyproject.org/use/ do not enter a ""port"" for most cases (including @link http://usegalaxy.org). advanced configuration is different – and the faq linked before has details about that. but you do not need to do that – defaults work fine for most people. if the data transfer stalls out while in progress, which files failed is noted near the bottom of the filezilla app in the tabs. timeouts can happen with slower connections or larger datasets and it is possible to resume the transfer where it left off within filezilla. note that this will usually prompt another security certificate pop-up. click to accept each time. if you are transferring many files and having problems, try transferring less files at a time. the transfer will only go as fast as your internet connection allows. university and business wifi connection speed is usually much faster than home wifi or cellular connection speeds. for personal internet/cell, most isps maximize transfer speeds and data transfers can be much slower – for the same service. there are many available an internet search will find them if you want to check yours. some universities or businesses block sending data outside of the entirely and others may only block some external sites for security purposes. if you think that @link http://usegalaxy.org is being blocked, contact your local administrators. some home/cell isps may also block or throttle where and/or how much data can be transferred. total or within a given time window. contact your isp for help if you think that is the problem. review prior qa about ftp at this forum. search with the keyword ""ftp"" to find those topics. you can also review prior qa at our older forum. the second post in this search is an identical issue to what you have, and using ""all defaults"" solved their problem: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/ galaxy biostars: retired qa archive (@link https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) add ""ftp"" part of the error message) into the keyword search already including ""biostar"" @link https://galaxyproject.org/search/?q=biostar+mlsd#gsc.tab=0gsc.q=biostar%20mlsdgsc.page=1 @link https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/p/24134.1.html hope that helps! i do not think

[INST] is there an issue with the servers? it is taking me a whole day just to upload some files, another day to run hisat2, and i have been waiting since yesterday afternoon for my stringtie data. [/INST] @quote it is taking me a whole day just to upload some files uploading data will take longer than usual if you are now working from a home internet connection instead of an institution/commercial connection. home internet services are almost always optimized for data download speeds, not upload speeds. try running a ""speedtest"" to find out what your connection speeds are. contact your isp provider to find out what options are available to increase speeds. there are several options – an internet search will find those appropriate for where you are located, or you can ask your isp provider for guidance. the internet, in general, is a bit slower for most right now, or at least not what it was before. more people working over home wifi plus phone connections, more people streaming entertainment during the day, etc. @quote another day to run hisat2, and i have been waiting since yesterday afternoon for my stringtie data. the galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org server is under very heavy load. this means that jobs will stay in the queued stage dataset) longer. the execution stage dataset) is about the same as before for most tools. there are simply more people using the server, for a variety of reasons, including distance learning. the best strategy is to queue up jobs, then allow them to complete. avoid deleting and restarting jobs in hopes of job running faster. restarting a job places it at the back of the queue again, extending wait time. only delete and rerun jobs if you already know there is some problem with the inputs/settings originally used. if you have not used workflows before, this might be a good time to learn/start using them. faq for jobs/datasets: datasets and how jobs execute (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/how-jobs-execute/) many gtn tutorials include workflows in the tutorial itself and most have a workflow that runs through all steps (except for data loading) that can be used as examples/templates. those under the topic cover simple cases for the ""how-to"". other topics cover intermediate/advanced methods for customization. galaxy training network tutorials: somegtntutorials are appropriate forgalaxy mainand some are not. where you can run each is noted per tutorial click on thegalaxy instancesgear iconto review thepublic galaxyserver choices. if a tutorial is supported by a pre-configuredgalaxy dockertraining image, instructions for how to get it will be listed below the tutorial listings, per category. note: there are a few tools running with reduced memory resources. these are listed in the top banner on the server. the banner will update or be removed as the situation changes. reduced memory does not impact how long a job takes to queue or execute but it can result in larger jobs failing for resources (even if they ran ok before). if work is urgent or you just want jobs to execute run faster, setting up your own galaxy server is an option. public servers are not the only choice. cloudman is popular for scientists as it requires very little administration, resources can be scaled up for your own needs, and all of that (except for the initial step) is gui based with built-in help. galaxy itself is always free but commercial storage and computational resources are not. aws has always offered grants for learning/research work, and they have extended that (or did last time i checked). i added a few tags to your post about cloudman please review for more details if this interests you, or see the links below for all choices. https://galaxyproject.org/choices/ https://galaxyproject.org/use/ delays are frustrating, but i hope this helps to explain the factors involved in the different kinds of delays most public galaxy servers are experiencing right now (not just @link http://usegalaxy.org), plus what you may choose to do to mitigate delays. good question! hopefully, the qa helps others to understand the current circumstances. best, jen

[INST] i noticed workflow versions (v1,v2…) in workflowhub and myexperiments but it is not available to the galaxy shared workflow. is it possible to get all versions of a particular workflow?? [/INST] @user are you talking about publishing a workflow on a galaxy instance so that others can find it under ""shared data"" if so, then the answer is: when people are importing a galaxy-published workflow into their own account they will import only the specific state the workflow is in at that moment. importing is a copy operation so afterwards the other user owns the copy and can start modifying, which will create new versions of their workflow. if you modify the original workflow later, this will be reflected directly in the published workflow in shared data, but will not affect the other user's copy. if they want to get your latest changes, they will need to re-import the published workflow, i.e. create another copy. the best way to deal with public-facing workflow versions is to export your workflow file and deposit it in a public version-control system. dockstore and workflowhub are repositories tailored specifically to scientific workflows, but you can use, for example, a github repo to host your workflow and people can use galaxy's workflow import functionality to get the workflow directly from there. this way everyone is aware of your versions and can refer to them properly.

[INST] i have put the download papanu.fa to history as my reference genome, but why it does not work when i do hisat2 for alignment with other fastq files [/INST] the statistics are there, for every hisat2 run by default. but if for some reason there were many or processing details, the statistic report will be after those lines, and you will not see it in the expanded dataset view. only the first few lines of stderr are captured here, as a ""peek"" view. technically, the underlying hisat2 tool reports the alignment statistics in a part of the job output named stderr. that is just how this particular tool works, and it does not necessarily indicate that there was an actual error/problem even though the name of that output includes ""err"" (abbreviation for ""error"") in it. all tools have a stdout and stderr output by default, although not all tool authors report meaningful data in those places. the galaxy wrapper around a tool can capture and (sometimes) reformat or add more information to the default stdout and/or stderr to provide more details. and some tool wrappers, like this one, have an option to report the interesting parts of those metadata as a distinct dataset in your history (just the statistics). how to review the full stderr message (any tool). for hisat2, this is where the alignment statistics are captured (at the end, any content above it is worth reviewing but does not necessarily mean that anything went wrong. in my example, the warnings are simply informing that there were some very short reads in my fastqsanger inputs. too short for the tool to map. a few of these kinds of warnings not unusual – but if my reads did not map well overall, could explain one reason why (perhaps qa was too aggressive or the data was not of high quality originally). a job's stdout can also be reviewed this way. plus, this is a method to review the tool parameters originally set/submitted in a simplified format (scroll further into the report than what is shown in the graphics below to find this information). this is a very useful report to learn how to review, and not only when something goes wrong (error or unexpected results). expand the result bam dataset and click on the details"" icon. this example happens to have too many warnings to show the statistics, and is probably similar to one of your jobs. hisat https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/9/907f5a05e7ad036c0870727ea11c0f2c7e40278d.png) the details"" report will display in the center pane. locate and click on the link to the stderr output. hisat https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/6/6c25da7e586c3666fb8b2e71d6a7f0886c7307d8.png) on the stdout report, scroll down past the warnings to find the statistics at the end. in this example, all of my warnings except for the last one before the actual statistics were not captured in the screenshot, on purpose, to keep the graphic smaller. the last line is from the wrapper and is just a processing detail that can be ignored. hisat (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/c/c80f5bba52d810c070e55755d576d061b2c483a8.png) how to capture only the hisat2 alignment statistics from the full stderr message into a distinct dataset report into the history. on the hisat2 tool form, expand the section ""summary options"" to access the parameter to ""print alignment summary to a file."" it happens to be set to ""no"" by default. in the graphic, i changed the option to be ""yes"", and the extra output dataset was created during job execution. it contains just the alignment statistics – in a cleaned-up format or technical run details). the statistics content is exactly the same as those found at the end of the stderr output above. hisat (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/d/d5bafd5c864440cfaedf706509674bece4caf2db.png) hope that helps!

[INST] hello, trying to use deseq2 for a couple of days now, i have the output of featurecounts, i also used limma voom successfully. however i need the tables with the p-value and the fold difference in expression so i try to get them via deseq2. i tried to compare the control with each mutant (4) but i think i got it wrong. i am not sure how to import the files correctly and i could not find any proper explanation of the factors. please help or an idea where to start from? :slight_smile: [/INST] dear sammy, ok where to start. well first here are the deseq papers: deseq2 (@link https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) and deseq https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106). then i would recommend to look into one of the galaxy training tutorial that uses deseq: reference-based rna-seq data analysis (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html). there is also a good biconductor post (@link http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/deseq2/inst/doc/deseq2.html) and a thorough document from the created and author here https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1983209/component/file_1983208/content). ah and for a visual and audio-tutorial you can watch this deseq2 series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufb993xufuu), which is quite intuitively explained. from your explanation i just guess that you do not received any p-vlaues with deseq2? if that is the case than the reason for that is probably that you only have one replicate for either mutant or control, or both. deseq2 needs at least two replicates two calculate a p-value. this has something to do with the variance estimation. i hope i could help you and have a nice day! florian .

[INST] hi, i have the following workflow: @link https://galaxy.embl.de/you/descoste/w/tesyatacseqmm10 it processes paired-end atac-seq data using mm10. this is a copy of an existing functional workflow to which i just modified trimmomatic to trim galore. i imagine that my problem is coming from this tool. indeed, the workflow blocks after bowtie2 and does not load all steps in the history. my question is, is there any log file where i can see where is the problem coming from? is the only way to solve the problem to rebuild the entire thing step by step? thanks, nicolas [/INST] welcome, @user! the server/shared link is not publically accessible, so we cannot help to review the problem in detail. i can let you know that certain earlier versions of trimmomatic did not work well in workflows for some use cases. changes included in recent galaxy releases (most current version is 19.01 (@link https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/index.html)) and to the trimmomatic tool itself (most current version 0.36.6 (@link https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/pjbriggs/trimmomatic/51b771646466)) resolved those issues. i would suggest contacting the administrators of that server to make sure galaxy/trimmomatic are at the most current versions, then modify the workflow to include that updated version of trimmomatic. if that does not resolve the problem, then also ask them to update the other tools included your workflow (including bowtie2), if not at the most current version available in the toolshed (@link https://usegalaxy.org/toolshed), to eliminate other potential technical issues as being a factor. other items to note: workflows populate output datasets into the history in the order of execution. this effectively means that not all steps will appear at the very start, but will show up as the processing proceeds over time. now, this is somewhat dependent on the server resources, the tools invoked, and whether or not dataset collections are included. so might want to check your history now and see if more content has populated since you first wrote in. you could also ask the administrators if the server is busy, causing a delay at the mapping step with bowtie2. this is a computationally intensive tool and usually takes longer to execute than trimmomatic. there is a known issue regarding ""input"" changes and workflow execution. the issue ticket is here, and you could try the workaround steps if you think this might be a factor: @link https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/7431. we are working to resolve the issue above and discussing ways to make workflow execution issues/conflicts clearer for ends users to aid with troubleshooting, directly in the interface, with priority. final option: test at the public server galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org to compare results. download/import the workflow, update tool versions (as needed), create a history with sample input data, and test it out to see what results. you might need to edit the workflow to remove any tools not available at this server (likely to be downstream of trimmomatic/bowtie2). if it works at galaxy main, that confirms the issue is at the other server. if it fails at galaxy main in the same way, a share link to that version of the workflow could be posted back, along with the shared history link, and we can review/help more that way. hope that gives some actionable choices to get this resolved!

[INST] i have posted the original question here, if you would like to answer from there too: @link https://www.biostars.org/p/9509800/ i have an (old) galaxy installation at a cluster that makes use of default python 2.7. i can see that there are 2 symlinks called python2 and python2.7 that maps to a python binary inside and calling it with returns 2.7.14 i recently installed a tool using tool.xml that has the following directive: the above directive tells galaxy to parse the entire ui from and create a json representation of the user choices, which is then passed to a perl script. when i ran the tool i got the following error: importerror: no module named since the tool and the wrappers are written in node and perl, i am guessing this has something to do with galaxy dependencies that is required to parse the directive above. i checked the default python from $path and it is version is 2.7.14 as well. when i go to /usr/lib64/python2.7 or /usr/lib64/python i can see that there is a folder structure - dom - minidom.py. so it means i already have this module installed. next i went to galaxy/.venv and i see there is a folder called lib and another called lib64 which points to lib itself. inside the lib there are many python scripts that are symlinks inside /usr/lib64/python2.7/. for example galaxy/.venv/lib/types.py maps to /usr/lib64/python2.7/types.py . at this point i have some questions: how can solve this dependency issue? shall i create a folder symlink called inside galaxy/.venv/lib that maps to /usr/lib64/python2.7/xml? would that be sufficient? - tried and this did not help should not these dependency symlinks be refreshed/created when galaxy is restarted? because when i restart galaxy, i still get the same error, meaning galaxy is still not aware that this module exists. additional information: lsb_release yields suse 15.1 i also have a local clone of galaxy ubuntu) from the repo that uses python 3.8 and cannot reproduce the error above in both galaxy instances (the local one that uses 3.8 and one at suse that uses 2.7) there is a file at location galaxy/lib/galaxy/util/__init__.py and here i can see both galaxy instances are trying to import however, in the older galaxy's __init__.py there is an additional line at the start of the script: from __future__ import absolute_import. would this affect the search path or because the problem in this question? [/INST] i do not really know. xml.dom is a standardmodule, so should be available. do you have a manipulated pythonpath somewhere? for example an xml.py file somewhere which confuses python?

[INST] hi, does anyone else have trouble running the pap structural workflow? for me it has been running for days now, and then it is now halted at 'mga to gff3' i have just uploaded my fasta file and run the workflow, with all default settings except for the 'create or update organism'. /lene [/INST] this might be the workflow you are using: @link https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub/you/cory-maughmer/w/pap-2019-structural-workflow-v810 if the workflow is erroring at different steps, the jobs may be exceeding the computational resources where you are working. or something else is wrong. you will need to contact their support – many of these tools are custom for this domain-specific server. each public galaxy is independently administered. if that server accepts bug reports, send one in. or you can contact them directly. some galaxy servers post contact on the home page and/or here: https://galaxyproject.org/use/. contact for this server (and the workflow author) happen to be posted on the homepage of the server: https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub plus also here @link https://galaxyproject.org/use/center-for-phage-technology-cpt/.

[INST] hi everyone, i would like to delete all lines from my vcf, where alt=""."" in order to only have the variants represented in my vcf. i thought i could youse the genotype filter in the tool vcffilter, but i actually want to keep those lines where an alt allele is reported, even though gt=""./."". i would be glad for help. thanks a lot! rose [/INST] the main problem with your pattern is that .+\t acts greedily, i.e. it tries to match as much of each line as possible while still enabling a match to the rest of the pattern. that is, the first .+\t may actually already span several columns. in your previous pattern with ann=, you prevent this by anchoring the match at that string (provided that ann= occurs only once per line in the info column). in your current pattern, however, the [.]+\t is too ambiguous since you may have other columns after alt ending in a. guess would be the filter column). this is why my revised suggestion defines a column explicitly as at least one character, which is not a tab and which is followed by a tab. the complete pattern then requires four such columns followed by a character that is not a. alternatively, a # as the first character on the line) followed by additional characters. if you prefer, you could also use the following not matching pattern, which is slightly shorter: ^([^\t]+\t){4}\. and simply says: skip all lines that are starting with four tab-separated columns and a. at the start of the 5th. in general, you can test your patterns locally in a linux terminal with: grep input_file # for a matching pattern grep input_file # for a not matching pattern similarly use grep -cp or grep -cvp if you just want to count the number of lines keep. , wolfgang

[INST] hi. i want to transfer a history that someone shared with me. i imported it into a galaxy account i had on one server (temporary- as part of a class i did). now i want to import it into my regular galaxy account. i tried using the email option, but then it says i cannot transfer to myself, so then i tried creating and copying the url, but nothing appears in my histories or shared histories. i used import from file to do this - wrong way? thanks. [/INST] if the server is still up and public, or you have downloaded the history archive, then moving the history to another server is possible. you state that the accounts are on different galaxy servers. this is why the share by email did not work. to share with another user by email, both accounts must be on the same server. all accounts on the same galaxy server will have distinct registered email addresses. galaxy faqs: options for data sharing (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/#data-options) loading/downloading data (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/#basics) tips: make sure the history is set as ""shared"" at the original server. this is required. click on the link in the archiving message (blue box) to get an updated status until noted as being completed and ready for import/download. the larger the history, the longer it will take the archive to build. permanently deleting any data not needed will make the history smaller and the archive creation faster. once the archive is ready, clicking on the link a second time will launch a download dialogue (where to save it, etc). this can be dismissed if you are not going to download it. copy the url instead for a direct galaxy-to-galaxy transfer. you can navigate away from the export page and do other thing while waiting (including logging out). but be sure to watch it, archived histories remain on servers for a set length of time (varies by the server, generally about a day or so). if clicking on ""export to file"" starts the archive creation again instead of taking you back to the original archive already in progress, the server might not support archive creation or you may have waited too long to check back. downloading a history archive locally from one server, then uploading it to another, works for almost all cases regardless of firewalls and other server configuration. if transferring by url fails, try that instead. keeping a backup of your work is a good idea anyway, plus these archives can be uncompressed to use the included datasets for other purposes.

how can i find out which server to use, per tutorial? help 1: servers host different tools. you can check to see which public galaxy servers are good choices per tutorial. these can change over time, and a server may actually host the tools but not be listed because the tool version was updated (meaning, the tool can be used but perhaps not exactly as described in the tutorial). how to use an updated tool is usually possible to figure out – but if you are not sure, can always ask – here topic) or even better at the gtn gitter chat: @link https://gitter.i am/galaxy-training-network/lobby (asking there may even get the tutorial updated). notes: the particular tutorial you reference has a dedicated docker image and is not technically/exactly supported by any public galaxy server – but you may still be able to use it at some of them. screenshots and more info below: @quote but when almost half of the analysis was done, i came to know that some tools used in the tutorial are only found atusegalaxy.orgserver. in fact all the analysis was done onusegalaxy.orgserver. now i am doing again all the analysis onusegalaxy.org. galaxy training network tutorials: somegtntutorials are appropriate forgalaxy mainand some are not. where you can run each is noted per tutorial click on thegalaxy instancesglobe icon menuand review thepublic galaxyserver choices. if a tutorial is supported by a pre-configuredgalaxy dockertraining image, instructions for how to get it will be listed below the tutorial listings, per category. screenshot of the hands-on for the tutorial you mention (the icon menu is also here, for each tutorial): gtn-tutorial-available-public-galaxy-servers-within-hands-on https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/d/d3a05d78b6d3941219dc6f8d7edd5cdf08261737.png) question 2: can i personally move data from one galaxy server to another?

question 3: can i personally move tools from one public galaxy server to another? help 3: no but you can request that tools are installed at other servers. or set up your own galaxy and install any tools you want (since you will be the administrator!). the tools at any public galaxy server are determined by the server administrators. notes: what is the tool not available at http://usegalaxy.eu? include the full name/version from the top of the tool form. the tool may be no longer be supported, have an updated version, or be replaced. or, maybe it has simply not been added yet. we can let you know and ask the @link http://usegalaxy.eu administrators if some tool install seems needed/possible – but no promises, they make the final decision. @quote or is there is any way i can ""transfer"" (use) the tools found onusegalaxy.orgtousegalaxy.euserver?

[INST] hello: i would like to filter a set of reads that were aligned using bowtie in a few different ways. 1. filter reads that map to a certain class of genes cds or trnas). 2. filter reads that contain a single mismatch. 3. filter reads that contain a specific mismatch (e.g. t to c). what tools would be suitable to perform these operations? thank you! [/INST] , (1) you can use bedtools intersect (bedtools intersect intervals find overlapping intervals in various ways) it works with bam files. you would need to provide an annotation for your cds or trnas. (2) you can use bam filter removes reads from a bam file based on criteria (3) this is actually not that straightforward my knowledge) and would need samtools (see this post extracting reads containing a specific variant from a bam file (@link https://www.biostars.org/p/86199/)). the question that comes immediately to my mind is, why you want to filter reads with a specific mismatch? because if you want to investigate specific variants and count how many reads support which variant, then this goes into variant callling (see here galaxy training!

[INST] hi, i am analysing the rnaseq data of the mosquitoe aedes aegypti. i need to map my reads using the reference genome aaegl5.0_gca_002204515.1. in the rna star tab, there is no a.aegypti ref genome and it was mentioned below ""if your genome of interest is not listed, contact the galaxy team (–genomedir)"". i could not find a way to do it. any advice? how can i solve this? is there a way to place the ref genome in here. [/INST] the tutorial is somewhat old. i believe ftp is not supported anymore. very often the reference genomes come in ""ready to use"" form. i never used normalizefasta, but i guess it would not hurt. make sure normalizefasta does not change the sequence names. the gene annotation file must use the same sequence names, as the reference genome. try mapping and read counting steps on one sample first, to make sure it works for you. upload the reference genome and gene annotations using urls (paste urls into galaxy upload menu paste/fetch data tab), examine the files using preview icon) and try mapping with, say, hisat2 followed by read counting using featurecounts. , igor

[INST] hello galaxy community, i am doing a rnaseq analysis and having problems with the tool featurecounts. i will give a short overview of what i have done so far and what error i get at the end. i checked the quality of my rnaseq files with fastqc tool since i work with pseudomonas i downloaded the genome reference (fasta) and annotated genome (gtf) from pseudomonas genome database https://www.pseudomonas.com/strain/download) 2b. i unpacked the files since they are in .x.gz format i used the tool hisat2 for the alignment of reads to the mentioned genome reference (fasta) i tried to link the aligned counts (hisat2 files) to genes with the annotated genome (gtf) and the tool featurecounts the job was cancelled and i got following error code: ""fatal error: exit code 255 error: no features were loaded in format gtf. the annotation format can be specified by the '-f' option, and the required feature type can be specified by the '-t' option… the porgram has to terminate."" the error code mentions something with format gtf. i double checked and the annotated reference genome was in the correct format. maybe i did something along the line that i was not supposed to do. i am relatively new to galaxy and i would very much appreciate your help. , marcel [/INST] , the problem is that by default featurecounts set exon as feature filter (advanced options/gff feature type filter), but this feature does not appear in the pseudomonas annotation file column). you need to specify cds as feature type in featurecounts. regards

[INST] hey all, i think there is a problem in galaxy. i am trying to feed some data into my workflow but it does not work. let me explain. so i have a collection of paired-end data (fastq-dump). the following options in hisat2 are: single-end, paired-end, paired-end dataset collection, paired-end data from single interleaved dataset. i chose paired-end dataset collection in hisat2 to build my workflow capture (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/2a8a7769014c98685829ee301529c21494887f4f.png) but i cannot connect them. it says: incompatible collection type(s) for attachment. however, outside the workflow, i do not have a problem uploading the fastq-dump in hisat2 with the paired-end dataset collection setting. why this discrepancy?is it because of the fastq-dump? also, is there any difference like this: (instead of choosing paired-end dataset collection) capture (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/7752eb192b930a27674e42912da4eacdb5114658.png) anyway, one more point: feeding collection into hisat2 workflow is almost impossible. situation 1: capture.png (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/b29a90bfcdcf994085393210cb46af403a176eab.png) my paired-end collection is not seen capture (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/4c401e63b06754e354b898e83b0bb46d29d570b0.png) situation 2: capture (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/bbf8f75209dba21c21a863c800670b6bb164bb11.png) same. it will not let me select my data. the only way that i found so far to have an workflow with hisat2 was to choose paired-end data from single interleaved dataset. but this means that i have to use fastq-interlacer on my raw samples before aligning them which takes so much time. i decided to give up on that. i should add that my workflow is not really complex. i have the input -- hisat2 -- filter sam/bam tool -- merging bams. last step is not essential. it may or may not be there for now at least). sorry for the long post. i hope is understandable and is making sense.

[INST] hello, i recently upgraded our local galaxy instance from 21.09 to 22.05 and i noticed two things: as recommended in the documentation, i switched from supervisor to systemd using the sample config file provided https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_22.05/admin/scaling.html?highlight=systemd#systemd): however, when galaxy is started this way, tools give errors such as: jobs_directory/052/52678/galaxy_52678.sh: line 9: mkdir: command not found as if the path was not right… if i start galaxy manually from the virtualenv using galaxyctl start, no such error appears. i had set up galaxy reports on ""/reports"", but could not find a way to start it again on a prefix in the new version. gravity states it handles galaxy reports, but it does not with the (modified) sample config file, and if i start it using run_reports.sh, it still only listens on ""host:9001/"", not setting galaxy_url_prefix does not change anything. am i missing something? [/INST] it is recommended to upgrade galaxy in the order of releases. did you first upgrade to 22.01, then 22.05? releases — galaxy project 22.05.1 documentation (@link https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/index.html) if not, the developers will likely ask for you to try that first. but let us see if they have advice now. i posted your question to the matrix admin chat. they may reply here or there, and feel free to join the chat. you are invited to talk on matrix (@link https://matrix.to/#/!rfldbcwewzapzrujix:gitter.i am/%24a00m8h5vzza22cgf52mpi5qnwi88pyqldmceaqr2elu?via=gitter.imvia=matrix.org)

[INST] i am having an issue with mapping using hisat2 and bowtie 2. i am trying to map my genome to a reference genome. both programs run, but the bam files only show is qname and all the other components of the table are blank. i have already gone through trimming and qc and the quality scores are all above 30. this is example of an error in mapping stats: warning: skipping mate #2 of read 'v300007992l3c001r0141268281/2' because it was 2 characters long warning: skipping mate #1 of read 'v300007992l3c001r020207830/1' because length # seed mismatches [/INST] this is when viewing the bam dataset, correct? only the first line will display immediately. bams are compressed data. viewing these is a special function in galaxy and it takes some time to load the data up in the application. i was able to look at one of your smaller results and it took a few minutes. the first line loaded first, then the header (fairly large from the custom genome), then finally the data lines after scrolling down the page. to view or work with the content in an uncompressed format, convert with bam-to-sam. to generate statistics on a bam dataset, there are many tools – search the tool panel with the keyword and/or review the tools under the group sam/bam.

[INST] hello, for several years i have been using galaxy to host my bigwig files, which i then visualize in the ucsc genome browser. just recently, i have found that galaxy does not allow this feature anymore. to elaborate: typically, i would upload my bigwig file to galaxy, and then i could simply click the bigwig file in my history to open a small box which displayed an option that said (maybe with different wording) ""view in ucsc."" clicking this option would immediately take me to the ucsc genome browser, with my bigwig file being displayed as browser tracks. this was great, and was exactly what i wanted. but in recent weeks, this option to ""view in ucsc"" has disappeared from my bigwig files being hosted on galaxy. there is no longer a clickable link that says ""view in ucsc."" could you help me understand what is going on? is this feature totally gone from galaxy? as in, do i need to find another host for bigwig files which i want to view in the ucsc genome browser? or is this feature still available in galaxy, but just re-worked in a way that i have not realized? to try an alternative approach, i clicked the ""copy link"" icon for my bigwig on galaxy, and tried pasting that link when i manually upload a custom track to the ucsc genome browser, but this approach is also not working prompts an error from ucsc saying that they could not open the file being specified by the link which i copied from galaxy for my particular bigwig). it seems strange that galaxy would still be okay with hosting our files, but not be okay with making those files (a bigwig file, in my case) viewable/accessible to other sites like the ucsc genome browser. [/INST] hello! yep, you guessed it it is still in galaxy but accessed a different way. we have consolidated all the visualization options to a single interface, and if you click on the visualization icon for the dataset in question: image and then in the middle panel at the top, this should be what you are looking for: image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/2/2ad2e2d6a9e845865fe0238962fca8109a1602ad.png) let me know if this is not working correctly for you and i can dig deeper. thanks!

[INST] hello galaxy community, i am new to galaxy and had a question while developing my local instance and running my files through the local instance. what i have tried so far: so i created a local galaxy instance with default configurations, and after becoming an admin following the guidelines in this tutorial: get galaxy https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/) i created a simple workflow by following this tutorial while i am still an admin in my local instance create and share workflows in galaxy - youtube (@link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2u4sg3uyqcab_channel=biscng) and wanted to share this with my end user as a service for rna-seq analysis keeping these rules in mind ten simple rules for setting up a galaxy instance as a service (@link https://galaxyproject.org/admin/ten-simple-steps-galaxy-as-a-service/) challenge: but once i log out of the web instance in which i was the admin and log back in as a non admin user into the same local instance i created, i am not able to see the workflow i created. i guess i was assuming that once the workflow is created, anyone who has access to the local instance can just access the workflow and run their files through it. to summarize: i am interested in sharing this workflow with my end user so that they can simply open up this galaxy instance, input their files and the files run through the galaxy instance which gives them the desired output in the end! how do i accomplish this? thank you in advance! -aditya natu [/INST] try this: log into your account with the workflow. share the workflow with all other users working on that same galaxy server by publishing it. publishing creates a url that can be shared with others, but also places the shared object directly under ""shared data workflows"".all users working on that same galaxy server will have access, and they can import and use the workflow in their own accounts. any account can ""publish"" into shared data: 1) histories (and the datasets inside of them), 2) workflows, 3) visualizations, 4) pages. any account can also ""share"" work. directly with the other person's account email address, or by generating a share link url and giving that url to them (however you communicate: text, slack, email, etc) only admin accounts can add data into shared data: 1) data libraries. it is a different way of organizing commonly used data and can save you some storage space since data in a data library imported by a user is just a linked clone of the original dataset. workflows do not consume any space at all in any account in terms of quota usage, but these files of course do consume a tiny amount of space on disk. that said, datasets and histories are much larger and matter more in terms of managing the overall disk size of your instance. faqs: galaxy support (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/) sharing and publishing your work (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/share/) data privacy features (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/privacy-features/) tutorials that include share functions: galaxy training! (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=share) webinars. the first and fourth will probably be of the most immediate use for you: galaxy-elixir webinars series: advanced features | elixir (@link https://elixir-europe.org/events/galaxy-elixir-webinars-series-advanced-features) note: the faqs and tutorials show a slightly older version of galaxy application changes fast!), but you should still be able to find the ""share or publish"" form for any galaxy object and share/set permissions how you would prefer to. in practical terms, you might want to not grant editing permissions the workflows if you want the users to import and run the workflow exactly how it is published. the webinar series was new this month, and includes operations using the most current galaxy version. hope that helps!

[INST] hi all, i am using galaxy to get terminator regions for all genes in a genome and i am using the 'get flanks' tool. question: does get flanks define the 3' end of the gene on the sense strand as the 'around end' regardless of the direction of transcription? so if the gene is transcribed from the antisense strand, get flanks would be taking the flanking region around the transcription start site…? i hope this makes sense, but let me know otherwise. thanks, david [/INST] if you include the strand in the bed6 input, the tool will extract upstream/downstream correctly. for any bed dataset browser faq (@link https://genome.ucsc.edu/faq/faqformat.html#format1)), the coordinate numbers are always with respect to the forward strand but which bases those represent depend on the strand assignment. scroll down on the tool form for the examples: both are extracting the same coordinates on different strands as output. those are based on different stranded inputs combined with some same parameters and some different parameters set on the form. if you are not sure or want to check settings against your data: try running the tool on a small sample that includes both strands and visualize the results in igv. thanks @system for linking to two posts together :slight_smile:

[INST] apologies if this is too chatty, not an actual problem, just an anomaly, and from experience anomalies are often signalling a hidden problem. basically, my local galaxy installation (runs within my university firewall) installation processes far faster than when i run the equivalent on a faster stand alone machine (native applications). worries me as to why? i doubt there will be a specific answer? so running 20gb fastq files through a workflow that concatenates across lanes then hisat2samtools sort/viewstringtie… on my galaxy server on an imac intel i3 4-core 24gb ram) takes about 12hrs. on my much newer imac sur) intel i9 8-core (16 virtual) 48gb ram this takes days. as far as i can see the command line options are the same except that the sever version adds fastq groomer and fastqc. any thoughts? it seems the samsort bundled within galaxy's hisat2 bam is the place where they are so different. richard [/INST] i guess i misunderstood, i thought you are comparing workflow invocation amongst two galaxy installations. but in this case it seems we are actually debugging your imac software configuration that is mimicking the galaxy workflow's dependency stack. this is possibly significantly more complex. i would start with validating the results – are they the same? if they are not i would probably install a galaxy instance on your imac and duplicate the workflow invocation properly. this will be rather easy compared to building the same dependency stack because in galaxy each step is executed in an isolated environment i.e. you can have different versions of the same dependency invoked during the workflow. controlling the number of resources with galaxy_slots has also possible significant effect on the speed of computation.

[/INST] , you should use kallisto quant; kallisto pseudo runs only the pseudoalignment step and is meant for usage in single-cell rna-seq. if you want to perform a differential expression analysis you do not need to normalize it. you can feed deseq2 with the output generated by kallisto. regards

[/INST] hi tom, we talked about this over email but i am posted back the highlights for others that may run into similar problems. action requires account activation. create an account and log into it to run compute-intensive tools (user register). faq registering accounts (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account/) @quote i was unable to complete the uploads and received an error that the account had not been activated. i went to the activation email, and now got an error message that the link was not valid, and that perhaps the account was already active. accounts have an activation step to confirm the registered email address is valid and belongs to you. activation links are sent via email and are active for about six hours. resend if needed using the password reset function login). as you noticed, activation emails can be sorted into spam or trash folders depending on email filters, so if others run into the same problem check in those locations or search your email account with the keyword ""galaxy"" if it seems to be missing. if you never get an activation email (can take a few hours to arrive, depending on how busy the server is), your email service may be rejecting the email. we have seen more of this occurring with institutional email services over the last year as updated security was implemented. contact your institution's administrators to request that emails from the @lists.galaxyproject.org and @galaxyproject.org domains are accepted. or, use a public email service instead. please delete any accounts that will no longer be used preferences) to avoid multiple account issues. account quotas at most public galaxy servers are one account per person per public galaxy server. meaning, it is fine to have a single account at each but you should not have more than one at any particular server. faq registering accounts (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account/) more help about using custom fasta datasets indexed with makeblastdb formatting of the fasta dataset matters. the usual custom genome format rules apply datatypes (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/datatypes/#fasta), plus blast has more options for parsing line/identifier content than other mapping tools problems with format usually do not show up until the database index created from the original fasta is mapped against. meaning, the job output from makeblastdb may appear to be successful (green), but the index is corrupted, and running blastn, blastx, etc will fail when mapping against that index. the stderr will report that the index cannot be found. the error will start with text like this and means that you need to correct the fasta format and rebuild the index. stderr blast database error: no alias or index file found for … (more details specific to your data) remove description line content. tool: normalizefasta using the option to ""remove content after the first whitespace"". wrap the sequence length to a value between 40-80 bases for the best results with most tools, including blast. normalize_fasta_custom_genome (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/e/eb90f788deca408e0dfd9ce8750acdc880be9dc2.png) the fasta identifiers can include alphanumeric characters (a-z, a-z, 0-9), underscores (_), dots and dashes (-). if you want to keep the description content, replace other characters with one of those. the goal is to produce sequence identifiers that are all one ""word"" with no whitespace (tabs, spaces) or other characters that blast cannot parse. avoid very long identifiers (over ~30 characters), or expect problems. search the tool panel with the ""replace"" keyword to find all tool options. replace text in entire line should work with most data. alternatively, a tool like text transformation with sed can also be used within galaxy. for example, a command like this will replace all commas with a dash in the entire file. s/,/-/g pipes (|) can be ok, but the fasta data containing these characters are best sourced from ncbi and the option parse the sequence identifiers should be used with the makeblastdb tool when creating the database index to map against. makeblastdb-header (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/3/342fffce64d8f8ae28cf289cb1f65105c34c5119.png) other options, then find this option and set it to ""yes: makeblastdb_ncbi_parse_identifiers (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/1/1ae1d328d02b5a1e5ad96c39fc0b1adb90b0a0d3.png) thanks for reporting the error, glad this is working for you now, and hope these tips help others :slight_smile:

[INST] hello, i am completely new to bioinformatics but was hoping to use salmon in galaxy to analyze gene-level expression in a time-series rna-seq dataset. based on the parameters i set and files i have included (transcriptome fasta and annotation gtf) i am able to get quantification of both transcripts and genes. i was wondering if there is a way to obtain information on the mapping rate? i know that alignment methods such as hisat2 or star produce alignment rates to assess how well the read mapped to the genome and subsequent assignment rates when counting with a method such as featurecounts. is there a similar output for mapping rate to assess how well my pair-end reads were assigned to a transcript/gene? thank you in advance! [/INST] @quote given these results is it safe to assume that the counts salmon is generating (quantification and gene quantification results) are based on everything that mapped includes reads that mapped either on their own or as a part of a paired-end fragment)? yes, this is all true as far as i know when using the default settings (mostly – coverage of a read against a transcript must be at least = 31 bases to count). to make the counting even more permissive, you could toggle either or both of these parameters to yes: ""allow dovetail"" or ""recover orphans"". to make what is counted up by salmon stricter permissive), toggle one or more of the other parameters on the form to yes. glad the prior info helped, and hope this does too :slight_smile:

[INST] hi all, i used kallisto to generate transcript abundance files for rnaseq data and am trying to run it through deseq2. my input is 4 .tsv files as well as a .gene_trans_map file, and the following error message is generated: note: importing abundance.h5 is typically faster than abundance.tsv reading in files with read.delim (install 'readr' package for speed up) 1 2 3 4 removing duplicated transcript rows from tx2gene error in $-.data.frame value character(0)): replacement has 0 rows, data has 510059 calls: get_deseq_dataset - - - -.data.frame i have tried changing a variety of parameters, including setting header to false, and i have also tried only using one dataset per factor level, and nothing is working to fix this error. i have also tried using a .gff3 file rather than a .gene_trans_map file, and that also is not making a difference. any advice would be much appreciated! thank you. [/INST] welcome, i see your bug report sent in from galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org. the problem is that your transcript fasta dataset identifiers do not match up with the transcript-to-gene mapping dataset. the fasta (data 14) and tmp (data 356 + 357 + 358 + 362) transcript identifiers are formatted as: tr100009|c0_g1_i1|m.500685 the tabular transcript-tab-gene dataset (data 347) has two problems: 1) truncated transcript and gene identifier formats that do not match the tmp inputs, plus 2) it looks as if the order might be reversed (gene-tab-transcript)? as long as the genes are named consistently, it does not matter what they are, but the transcript names do need to match the other inputs. tr1|c0_g1 tr1|c0_g1_i1 in short, primary ids need to be in the same exact format across all inputs or tools cannot match data up. this is true for any tool, not just deseq2. the gff3 dataset is missing a header line: ##gff-version 3. that is why it was given the more generic gff datatype during upload, and why the tool form does not recognize it as a valid input. also, replicates are required with deseq2 in galaxy. faq: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/ extended help for differential expression analysis tools (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/different-expression/) hope that helps!

[INST] we are in the middle of setting up a new galaxy server and currently installing tools - mixed toolshed and locally developed code. quite a lot of our tools are currently failing with error: conda dependency seemingly installed but failed to build job environment. this includes bcftools, gatk (3.x), and others. looking through the manage dependencies panel, the ones with issues often have multiple dependency requirements, with conda as the resolver and separate environment paths listed. other, working tools with multiple requirements via conda give the same mulled-v1-hash environment path for all of them. now, we do not have the mulled beta enabled right now, and i am not sure we ever did, so i do not know how these were sourced. we also are not caching the dependencies, although maybe we need to. has anyone seen this behavior, or have any troubleshooting suggestions? is there a latency factor here - could it fail due to time taken to build the env across filesystems? [/INST] no, it is all fine. make sure all your tools that have multiple requirements are using a conda environment that starts with mulled-v1-. this should happen automatically, but can be very slow. the installation progress is logged in your log file. if for some reason this does not happen you can trigger the installation in the manage dependencies menu. have an eye on the logs when you do this, you will see the commands that will be executed.

[INST] hi all. after having used deseq2, my results show up as nucleotides (per ncbi: search ncbi databases - nlm (@link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/)) instead of genes. do you know what causes this and how i could find out the correct gene ids? [/INST] the content of the gene_id and transcript_id fields of the reference annotation gtf are what featurecounts uses to generate the counts. mapped hits at the level transcript coordinates) are summarized per ""gene_id"" in that output. then, those gene_id level counts are interpreted by deseq2 for differential expression. for this data, the annotation was predicted using an automated annotation pipeline developed by ncbi. to review the general stats for the annotation, and the pipeline details, go to the assembly page here asm2155985v1 - genome - assembly - ncbi (@link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/gcf_021559855.1/#/qa) and expand the section ""comment"" the annotation was added by the ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline information about pgap can be found here: ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline (@link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/) example line from the public gtf nz_cp058222.1 protein homology cds 1 1401 . + 0 gene_id transcript_id gbkey gene inference ""coordinates: similar to aa sequence:refseq:np_418157.1""; locus_tag product ""chromosomal replication initiator protein dnaa""; protein_id transl_table ""11""; exon_number ""1""; what those values represent nz_cp058222.1 == chromosome identifier, pairs with the genome fasta on the title line value (everything before the first whitespace) and the third column in bams generated via mapping against the fasta. those bams were not in the shared history but that is ok – are the bams you input to featurecounts (maybe in another history, or locally on your computer, or some other online tool) gene == the gene the pipeline guessed as the closest valid match. this is what you could lookup, example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=dnaa gene_id and locus_tag ""hw370_rs00005"" == both are the same value. this is a distinct name, presumably since more than one locus could be assigned to the same via the pipeline's algorithm. technically, ""gene_id"" must be unique in any single assembly's annotation – most tools will error or produce weird results if there are any duplications. you could transform the gtf to a tabular format with gffread then use join two datasets side by side on a specified field to map gene_id/locus_tag gene in batch. tutorial with these and more manipulations: data manipulation olympics (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/tutorial.html). you can also search the tool panel with the keyword ""gtf"" to find more tools to manipulate or extract (or extract and simplify) any other attribute data you are interested in mapping the gene_id/locus_tag value to (the first column in the deseq2 output table). example: you want to map to the ""inference ""coordinates: similar to aa sequence:refseq:np_418157.1"""" you would need to strip all the extra content until just the np value remains to use that key in a search to get the associated protein fasta. hope that helps!

[INST] hello! i am an undergrad and am in desperate need of any assistance, as my mentor is not familiar with bioinformatics! i am using galaxy to do differential gene expression rna sequencing and am following galaxy's tutorial (reference-based rna-seq data analysis (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html#mapping)). i have 12 pairs of pair-end samples in fastq format of hela cells. i did qc and did not do cutadapt as one online source stated that it was not necessary if i would be using star to map my sequences. (do you think that this was a smart decision?) right now, i am trying to use star to map my sequences to the homo_sapiens.grch38.109.gtf file, but i keep getting the following error: ""fatal input file error, no valid exon lines in the gtf file: /jetstream2/scratch/main/jobs/49599174/inputs/dataset_b28934b5-2b19-"" i used a file from ensemble and retried with one from ucsc, but both gave the same error. what should i do for my next step? thank you so much in advance for your help! i really appreciate it!! :slight_smile: [/INST] popular aligners use soft clipping (ignore unmappable nucleotides at reads' start and end). you will see it in cigar string, eg 12s50m means 12 soft clipped nucleotides at alignment start followed by 50 matches. for additional information check specification of sam format. you can check role of adapters and compare counts from original and trimmed reads. what important: treat all samples in the same way. we do see elevated rate of errors when rna_star is used with gene annotations. gapped aligners can map reads across splice sites without gene annotations. personally, i prefer two step approach, mapping and reads counting. some tools have built-in gene models for popular organisms 1: rna-seq reads to counts (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-reads-to-counts/tutorial.html#counting) usually i import annotations, so i know what is used. rna_star provides very limited control over read counting, while featurecounts and htseq-count allow selection of attributes and features. it is hard to say why the job failed without checking the annotation file. the annotation and the reference genome should be for the same version of genome assembly, with identical chromosome/contig names, for example, chr1, chr1 and 1 might be considered as three different text strings/names. maybe try hisat2/featurecounts approach described in the tutorial above on one sample to see if it works for you. hope that helps. , igor

[INST] hello what is the best tool for deduplication for my data? let us say i have more than 50% duplication in my reads, how should i remove them. i saw some tool but i am not sure which one is best for my analysis. thanks [/INST] , in the case of mirna, i suggest you go on with the analysis without considering the gc and duplication content for this reasons: mirna sequences usually contain overrepresented motifs that could interfere with the real duplication values (because in many cases they have been originated from duplications). the mirna gc content is quite variable, and depending of the organism, the mirnas can be enriched in those nucleotides (lam et al. https://norgenbiotek.com/sites/default/files/resources/total_rna_purification_kit_effect_of_microrna_gc_content_on_rna_purification_efficiency_application_notes_68.pdf), mishra et at. (@link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2825596/)). what tool did you use to perform the alignment? regards

[INST] hi, this is a complete beginner question and this probably belongs to the rtfm section. however, there is obviously a logic that i do not understand in galaxy xml. what i want to do (independently of whether or not you can do that with existing tools in galaxy), is to give a list of bed files to my tool, and output a tab like: of lines file1 4645464 ... ...... filen 346354345 here is my xml file: bash $__tool_directory__/bedcounts_summary.sh $key in $bedlist.keys() # $key #end for todo: fill in help.]]> here is the bash script: bedfilename=$1 bedfile=$2 countslines=`wc echo -e ""$bedfilename\t$countslines"" this is returning only the first line. i managed to have all lines using a simple echo but that is not the point, obviously. if you can point to my logic/programming error that would be very helpful! thanks! [/INST] it is because you are passing your script two arguments per collection element but your script only takes two arguments. you need to wrap the entire call to your script in the block. look at the command in the info section of the tools output. you will see your mistake.

[INST] hi everyone, i am new to galaxy and i am facing a conda environment problem lately on the http://usegalaxy.org main server. i am trying to map my data on the human genome using the rna star tool but whenever i execute my jobs on the http://usegalaxy.org server, i have this error: failed to activate conda environment! error was: line 110: /cvmfs/main.galaxyproject.org/deps/_conda/bin/activate: no such file or directory and all of my files are empty. i tried to do the same mapping step with hisat2 and tophat tools but i still face the same error. however, i tried to follow the galaxy tutorial on rna-seq analysis reference-based rna-seq data analysis (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html?utm_source=galaxy-workshoputm_medium=courseprogramutm_campaign=galaxy-workshop) and i do not have that problem. can someone tell me if i am doing something wrong or is it problem occurring within the server? thank you! [/INST] check these two items. the first may or may not be ok (worth checking), and the second is likely a content problem (mismatched chromosome names). both might need to be adjusted. @quote i have paired-end reads and i select multiple datasets. make sure that the pairs are entered in the same order on the tool form, and that none of the ends of any pairs are omitted. you can click into the ""i"" job details page to see what was originally submitted to check (even for failed jobs). if you have many paired end datasets, using dataset collections would help: search tutorials (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=collection) yes, i am using a built-in reference genome human genome (hg38)) without a built-in gene model. as for the gene model, i specify .gtf file (grch38) downloaded from the ensemble database. the reference genome was sourced from ucsc when we indexed it on the server. all other inputs must use that same genome/build, including the same chromosome naming formats, or tools will either ignore the mismatched input or trigger a failure. the reference annotation model) was sourced directly by you… from ensembl (?). they use a different chromosome name format than ucsc. where to get the annotation with ucsc chromosome names is in this prior qa: @quote thehg38reference annotationgtfis now best sourced from ucsc. not from the table browser but from thedownloads area here. there are a few gene tracks to choose from. you can review what each of those represents then upload the selectedgtfto galaxy with theuploadtool. just copy and paste in the url and leave all other settings at the default. the correct datatype will be assigned. nothing else pops out. so, please try using the ucsc gtf instead with rerun(s). if any still fail, please send in a bug report from one of the red error datasets, and include a link to this topic in the comments so we can link the two for context. also, please leave all datasets undeleted (inputs outputs, successful or failure) for review. thanks!

[INST] perhaps this is an easy one, but i have not yet found the answer. can anyone tell me if there is a galaxy tool that will filter a fasta (specifically a protein fasta) to yield only the longest isoform per gene? by the way, i understand that the longest isoform may not be the best, but this is a way of getting a multi-fasta with one entry per gene. i have proteomes in fasta format downloaded from uniprot and also ncbi. something about the formatting of these fasta files is not letting me use the perl https://www.biostars.org/p/224965/), python https://github.com/hahnlab/cafe5/blob/master/docs/tutorial/longest_iso.py), and are (@link https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/595/how-can-longest-isoforms-per-gene-be-extracted-from-a-fasta-file) suggestions i have found on various help forums. some of them returned a file with almost nothing in it. part of this difficulty is likely owing to my naivete for troubleshooting code. a solution on galaxy would be good, and would also be invaluable to others who need this as part of their workflows. thanks for any tips! [/INST] it is an interesting question. i am not aware about a dedicated tool on galaxy for this purpose. files from ncbi and uniprot might use different rules for sequence names, hence, require different processing. you can do it in galaxy. you need a tabular file with columns for gene name, transcript name, sequence length and protein sequence. the order of columns is irrelevant, and the file can have other columns. usegalaxy.* servers usually have tools for all steps needed, like getting sequence length, fasta to tabular conversion, splitting text into smaller string. the processing depends on sequence names. once you get the tabular file, use datamash: group by gene name print all fields from input file: set to yes no) operation to perform: maximum on column with sequence length this operation selects a longest sequence per gene and print the entire line from the input tabular file. tabular file with longest sequences can be converted into fastq using tabular-to-fasta converter. develop a workflow using a small subset of data, check the output, and use it with fill sized dataset. here an example galaxy australia | accessible history protein length (@link https://usegalaxy.org.au/you/igor/h/protein-length) hope this answers the question. , igor

[INST] hi if there is a low mapq in my reads. someone tells me to use samtools view in.bam ""chr1:234-567"" to explore the reads in the region of the gene. he said: your read counter might be refusing to count reads that do not align uniquely. this tool will let you count reads in the region, even if your read counter will not assign them to a gene. but i do not know how do it in galaxy? i am be grateful if someone can help me . this is our conversation link: @link https://www.biostars.org/p/381880/ [/INST] hi, two things: to answer the question you are asking here. if you already know how to inspect your reads with igv you are mentioning in your linked post on biostars), there is not anything samtools view could tell you in addition. if you hover over any read of interest in igv (depending on your setting you may also have to click on it), you should get a pop-up info window that also has the info about the read's mapq score. samtools view is not directly available through galaxy as a dedicated tool. to get the functionality you want you could combine the tools slice bam https://usegalaxy.org/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/samtools_slice_bam/samtools_slice_bam/2.0.1) and bam-to_sam (@link https://usegalaxy.org/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bam_to_sam/bam_to_sam/2.0.1), where the first one allows you to extract the reads mapping to a particular region, but outputs them in binary format, while the second tool would turn that output into the same text format that you would get with samtools view as suggested to you. there are lots of reasons why specific reads may not be counted by featurecounts and some of them can be controlled through the options for paired-end reads and the advanced options of the galaxy tool. in particular, check these settings: exclude chimeric fragments: if set to true, then paired-end reads will only be counted if both mates map to the same chromosome count multi-mapping reads/fragments: if disabled, then any reads mapping ambiguously to more than one location will not get counted minimum mapping quality per read: if the aligner gave the mapping of the read a mapq score less than the threshold you set here, the read will not get counted. in addition, the last two settings above can be somewhat confusing when you align with star because star uses a very simplified mapq scoring scheme, in which it assigns mapq 255 to every uniquely mapping read. reads that map ambiguously to 2 locations get mapq 3, those with 3 or 4 mappings get mapq 1, and those with 5+ mappings get assigned mapq 0. this means that if you use star for alignment and go with the default minimum mapping quality per read of 12 in featurecounts, you will, effectively, ignore all multimapping reads even if you enable count multi-mapping reads/fragments.

[INST] hi martin, thank you so much for your reply! we have since referenced the info you provided and updated our galaxy to the 19.01 release. it is weird that following the upgrade, while the font/color theme of our galaxy ui has been changed to the same of your public main galaxy server, the tool pane layout/organization remains unchanged. one of the possible reasons might be that we did not use the ansible for the tool installation and update. speaking of the ansible, we do have a very important question for you: we realize that the galaxy team is now recommending ansible for setting up, managing and upgrading galaxy. our question is if this ansible approach is now galaxy's team's official strategy going forward? in late 2018, we tried the galaxy kickstart, and ran into several issues (ftp, postgresql, etc.). we are unsure if the current ansible approach has resolved those issue. we would appreciate your comments! thanks again, usc libraries bioinformatics service [/INST] @quote is if this ansible approach is now galaxy's team's official strategy going forward? yes. @quote we are unsure if the current ansible approach has resolved those issue. i do not know what issue you ran into, but be assured that @link http://usegalaxy.org, http://usegalaxy.eu, http://usegalaxy.org.au, and many other galaxies are being deployed using ansible.

[INST] hi, i am very new to galaxy and with no knowledge in bioinformatics. i am trying to analyze some scrna seq data from cryptococcus neoformans. i have been trying (unsuccessfully) to use the gtf2genelist tool to generate the filtered fasta and transcript gene-map using a gtf file and fasta file downloaded from the ncbi https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/gcf_000149245.1/), for later running alevin every time i run the tool the same error appears: fatal error: exit code 1 (). i would appreciate if you could tell me what is that meaning and if you have any suggestions. thanks a lot for the help. , diana t.

[INST] how can i incorporate an annotated bacterial genome for rna sequencing analysis using galaxy? [/INST] thanks for explaining use a custom genome fasta and optionally promote that to a custom build to create a ""database"" metadata that be assigned to datasets. some tools use the fasta directly and some tools require/use the metadata. tip: avoid assigning an existing ""database"" to any data that is associated with a custom genome fasta instead create your own custom database key to avoid content conflicts that can be difficult to interpret. the general flow is usually: upload the genome fasta to galaxy upload the genome annotation to galaxy is usually best) standardize the format of both make sure the ""chromosome"" ids are an exact match between the fasta and gtf remove any extra content from the fasta title line remove any # header lines from the gtf gff3 would have at least one) create the custom build ""database"" for the standardized fasta done and ready to start an analysis project these faqs explain the ""how to"" reference-genomes (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#reference%20genomes) @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#adding-a-custom-database-build-dbkey working-with-fasta-datasets (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#working-with-very-large-fasta-datasets) working-with-reference-annotation (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#working-with-gff-gft-gtf2-gff3-reference-annotation) you can also search this forum with keywords to find prior qa about troubleshooting problems. i also added a few tags that do the same. you will notice that most of those involve format problems and link back to those faqs or variations of them. getting both of these reference files prepped and ready to use, at the very start and before starting the actual analysis, will make life happier :slight_smile: @quote however, i am having difficulties with the featurecount tool downstream. we usually only index reference genomes and not reference annotation since the latter changes so frequently. the problem is likely with the current format of your fasta or gtf or both. the help above usually solves those kinds of errors. the custom genome functions works great for bacterial sized (or smaller) genomes, and sometimes is better than a native index. why? it is easier to compare the ids when both datasets are in a history (and not behind an index) and it is something you can do immediately without waiting for the public sites to be updated. so, please give that a try, and if the errors persist, you can post back a shared history link (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#sharing-your-history) that contains both reference datasets and the error data (inputs and outputs undeleted) and we can try to help more. that can be public as a reply, or ask for a private message chat to be started up and you can share the history url in that. note: larger genomes (mammalian, some plants) do benefit from server-side indexes – and we would need a link to the data source for those. the associated annotation data would still be uploaded/standardized independently in the working history by you. any annotation data that can be indexed on the server is probably already available (rare, and only for a few tools). @quote yes, i am using bwa tool and the reference genome that i need to use is not included. i used the fasta format and the auto option for the algorithm for constructing the bwt index (as one of the options suggested). however, i am having difficulties with the featurecount tool downstream. the tool choice could also be a problem – but not necessarily since you are working with a bacterial genome. general usage: bwa is for mapping unspliced reads (wgs, chip-seq, others) hisat2 and bowtie2 are for mapping spliced reads (rna-seq) featurecounts is for counting up the abundance of transcriptome features from rna-seq experiments (mostly). for examples, including workflows, please see our tutorials here galaxy training network (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/) galaxy training: transcriptomics (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/) training material for all kinds of transcriptomics analysis.

[INST] hi, wanted to ask for some advice regarding rnaseq data analysis using salmon. i was going to use this tool to align my rnaseq data to human reference genome and then obtain the read counts for downstream deseq2 analysis. i obtained human reference genome data from ensembl (cdna) in fa.gz format. however, i see that for the alignment, i need to have alignment files in format. i also seem to need gtf files to map transcripts to genes? i am a little bit at a loss on how to proceed with the alignment. at the moment i have trimmed rnaseq data in fastsanger.gz format and that cdna reference from ensembl, but i understand some intermediary step is needed? would appreciate any advice on how to proceed - most salmon tutorials i have looked at were for count quantification or written for advanced users of bioconda etc., and the threads on this forum cover issues dowstream of the initial alignment steps. so at the moment i am struggling would appreciate your help! [/INST] , salmon works on a reference transcriptome. you do not need alignments: salmon takes fastq files. because of alternative splicing, you need a file with transcript to genes map. i had less issues with a tabular transcript-to-genes map file. here is my old history with salmon: galaxy | australia | published history transcript quantification with salmon 2018/06/08 (@link https://usegalaxy.org.au/you/igor/h/transcript-quantification-with-salmon-20180608) you may also consider a traditional approach: mapping with hisat2 and read counting with featurecounts. gtn provides several detailed tutorials for this approach. , igor

[INST] i am relativerly new to galaxy, and i am sorry if this is a very basic question. my main question is what is the intended way to keep permanent record of what has been done to what files in complicated analysis. i have run analysis and now is the time to delete the bulky files and make space for another analysis. is the intended method for keeping record of tools and parameters just the ""history""? my history is relatively messy, because i tried several options of a tool before settling on final analysis. my history also contains intermediate steps of large files i had to delete for space reasons. i thought i could extract workflow from history and cleanup the abandoned branches and keep the workflow as record of the analysis. however, the intermediate deleted files/steps are not part of extracted workflow. is it possible to extract workflow including deleted intermediate files/steps? [/INST] please review this faq for help about managing data, freeing up quota space, and saving prior analysis work: account quotas (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account-quotas/) for the extracted workflow problems, it sounds like you will need to directly edit the workflow. workflows are a record of the tools/actions used to create data. workflows do not contain data themselves. if you deleted intermediate datasets, the tools/actions that created them might not have been extracted, or possibly may just have disconnected tools/actions within the workflow. tips: workflows can be created ""from scratch"" or extracted. sometimes a bit of tuning in the workflow editor is needed when doing either until it runs as expected. you can reconnect tools or add back any tools/actions that are missing from the workflow by editing it. intermediate datasets can be deleted while executing a workflow to save space. this is a per-tool ""action"". tool actions listed in the far right panel of the workflow editor when a tool is selected from the canvas. if you add or adjust workflow steps, you may need to disconnect/reconnect all the ""noodles"" between tools again to reset the workflow's metadata. reconnect starting from the inputs down through the analysis in the order of execution. once this workflow is working as expected, try running it again with the original inputs all in one new clean history. that way you can create a ""history archive"" and download it, along with the associated workflow, for a complete record of your work. all of your datasets (that were not deleted while running the workflow!) will be inside the archive and can be used any way you want. you can even import that history archive + workflow into your own local galaxy, to view the data in context, but i would not try running the workflow locally unless you set up a more complicated local galaxy, or decide to use a cloud galaxy. if you are an academic researcher, and need a bit more temporary quota space, most public galaxy servers will grant that. each handles requests a bit differently. let us know if you cannot find where/how to request temporary quota space at the server you are working at back the server url). please see faq above with more details about most of this, plus the tutorials below for how to extract/edit workflows. gtn tutorials that cover creating or editing a workflow are here. scroll down past the analysis tutorials, the ones you will be most interested in are listed lower down with the search term. https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=workflow https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=workflow galaxy training (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=workflow) collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the w... hope that helps!

[/INST] were the jobs queued (gray in color) when you wrote in? that means they were staged and will process as resources become available. after 4 days, those likely completed. all public galaxy servers are very busy, not just @link http://usegalaxy.org/. all compute-intensive jobs are queuing longer than usual due to the high load on the servers and clusters. jobs queuing for several days would not be unusual, and even then only a subset of jobs may run at a time. avoid deleting and rerunning – that will only place the jobs back at the end of the queue again, further extending wait time. using workflows is a good way to ensure work proceeds at the fastest possible rate. the entire analysis is queued up and will run as resources become available, without intervention. you can also queue up jobs directly. having many queued jobs is fine. the work will generally execute in the order submitted – but some tools may route to a different cluster than others and run out of order dependent on some upstream job to run). so yes, there are some limits on the number of concurrent jobs anyone will have (actually running then completing, not just queued) but what tools those are can also be a factor. if you have urgent work, setting up your own galaxy server is an option, too. i added a few tags to your post that will link to other qa about all of this, including faqs and resource links. but if you have a specific question that does not seem to be addressed yet or anything is unclear, we can try to help more/clarify directly here. thanks!

[INST] hello i want to use the inspect anndata tool to generate a matrix from my data. the annotation file that i give to this tool as input is about 26 gb and every time the output of this tool turns red. is it because of the large amount of data? and if so, is there a way for me to get a matrix from my annotation data? thank you in advance for your advice [/INST] you started to ask a question in this thread problem using import anndata tool - #2 by jennaj (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/problem-using-import-anndata-tool/8568/2) but there was not any followup. i will close that thread and we can continue here. we cannot help without more details. many things can contribute to job failures. if you think the data might be corrupted, or too large to process (unlikely if you are working at http://usegalaxy.eu), these are a few items to try: check to make sure that this very large file is intact. the inspect anndata tool can be used to collect general information as a sanity check. try converting just parts of the file to a matrix, or other summaries, instead of all of it. the errors (if any) from this might inform more about what might be wrong. after running more checks, if you have an error that you do not understand, you can post that back with information from your checks so people can help you to troubleshoot. this can include job parameters, error messages, and (optionally) a shared history. more help is in the single cell tutorials here, including more qa/qc checks: galaxy training network (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/) galaxy training: transcriptomics (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/) training material for all kinds of transcriptomics analysis.

[INST] i am working on rna seq analysis and am trying to add a t/f significant differential gene expression column onto my deseq2 results for use in goseq. compute is failing when it gets to rows with na listed as the p-value because it is not converting the strings to floats, but even when i play with the error-handling options it is failing no matter what. i am using c70.05 as my function where c7 is the adj. p-value. i have already tried to skip the row produce an empty column to deal with the errors. tia [/INST] @user glad to hear that the gtn was helpful. @system just to clarify how the different error handling options are interconnected: the most important option with conversion errors like this is autodetect column types. conversion to the types galaxy has recorded for all columns is otherwise the first thing the tool does, and this does not count yet as trying to compute the expression. so if this step fails, that is that. after you have disabled the above option, you will have to use an extended expression that does the type conversion itself, like float(c7). now, in this case here, that attempt will also fail, but now the failure is part of computing the expression, and can be handled via if an expression cannot be computed for a row fail on references to non-existent columns does not matter in the case here because the column does exist, just its value cannot be converted to a float. you are right, of course, that if a missing column is the issue, then you need to set this option to no and configure error handling at the same time.

[INST] hi, i am leaning from the ''exome sequencing data analysis'' tutorial in order the develop the skill to analyze my genomics data against the reference genome for identifying variants on the specific genes of my samples. i followed the tutorial to use the ''snpsift annotate'' to give variant id to the vcf file of the however, the dbsnp vcf file (dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf) offered in the tutorial does not contain id information. so i could run snpsift annotate, but the output vcf still does not have id. i also downloaded the dbsnp vcf file from the ncbi database. i could not run the snpsift annotate of the vcf'' against the ncbi dbsnp vcf, i guess it is because the chromosomes in the ncbi dbsnp vcf file are not named as ''chr#'' but only ''#''. do i understand the error correctly? any suggestions how i can solve this? many thanks. susan [/INST] hi susan, so you are trying a tutorial that is currently broken in several ways, and i am feeling somewhat guilty because i was planning to fix it last week but did not get round to it. however, by diagnosing correctly the first problem, and even trying to work around it, you are demonstrating that you have a sound understanding of the topic. indeed, the dbsnp file used in the tutorial is not what it is supposed to be. i would have thought that the different chromosome names between your vcf and the ncbi file could be handled by snpsift, but it is possible that they pose a problem. one other possibility i could think of is that the genome versions differ. did you download the dbsnp hg19 or the hg38 version? anyway, you do not really need to run this step at all when using gemini next because that tool knows about the dbsnp ids anyway. however, if you are working on http://usegalaxy.org, you will soon find out that gemini is not currently available there. you can find it on http://usegalaxy.eu, but at a newer and heavily reworked version than what is described in the tutorial. so overall this experience will not be as comfortable as it should be, and i am sorry for that. if this is not super urgent, you may be better off waiting 1 or 2 weeks longer for my fixes. best, wolfgang

[INST] trackster will not let me add multiple datasets, it keeps getting stuck when i click 'add new' in 'loading histories'. help! [/INST] welcome, yes, trackster is a bit problematic right now. specifically, add more datasets to an existing visualization does not work (at least for all cases i have tested). the same is true whether the visualization is based on a built-in database or a custom genome build's database. we are working to fully characterize the problem and get it fixed quickly. a development ticket exists (too cryptic to post, and we are not quite sure if it will fully resolve the issue) so i will post the end-user oriented issue ticket back once completed, likely early monday. more testing is needed first. but we wanted to let you know now that we are aware of the problem, plan to fix it with priority, and appreciate that you took the time to create a public post about the issue. it will help both you and others. until trackster issues are resolved, alternative genome browsers are listed in an expanded dataset when the database is assigned. common options linked are below. depending on any particular dataset's metadata (datatype, database), other visualization options may display as linked resources. ucsc main – only some genomes are available. if a link does not show up, it is not at ucsc. igv – are a few versions, with links presented as appropriate. the publically hosted version has many genomes available. a local version is easy to download/install, has a gui interface, and can have even more pre-built indexes added in. igv also has the option to create your own custom genome index in a local igv, matching a custom genome build created in galaxy, to view multiple datasets together with the genome fasta backbone. if you just want to browse a single dataset from a novel genome, a scaffold index will be created on the fly. more details for using igv are in this prior qa. you can also click on the tags i added to your post to find more related qa in the content of different use cases.@quote the assembly is done, but moving the data into any 3rd party external application can require some reformatting or the creation of additional files that the other application is expecting – or they can require none – it depends on the external application. in this case (igv), a fasta index is required for new genomes. this would be true even if you decided to load the fasta directly into igv as a new genome (instead of loading it directly from galaxy). the ""galaxy-to-local igv"" data web-based l… thanks for reporting the issue!

[INST] hello, i have a matrix and i want the header values of its columns to move to the end of the matrix the size of a column because the header of each column is placed on top of the previous column and the last column is left without a header. please tell me what tool to use? [/INST] this tutorial covers many common data manipulations: data manipulation olympics (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/tutorial.html) the manipulation will probably go something like this: isolate the header line from the matrix add a new column to the start of that header line put the header back on the matrix note: if are you viewing the dataset in galaxy with the :eye: and noticed this as a potential problem, consider using the cut tool first, to isolate the problematic column and double check that the header is actually missing. sometimes the matrix header or the data values are so long (or short!) that they skew the view but the data content itself is ok.

[INST] hello, i am currently trying to run a sort on some bed files. the instructions for the sort are: sort however, i am having difficulty translating this to the sort tool in galaxy. is the k1, k2, k3 referring to the columns? and if so, what do 1, 2n and 3n refer to? any help would be appreciated. [/INST] you have this right: sort use the sort tool in galaxy -k1,1 means to start sorting at the first column and stop sorting this way at the first column (otherwise the sort would apply from whatever the ""start"" was until the end of the line). limiting to the first column is important because the ""sorting type"" to apply differs by column. in this case, the sorting is ""alphabetical"". but see the tool form alphabetical for any letters in the first column (a-b) will be what humans expect but any numbers after may not be. example: comes before ""2"" because the first character of ""11"" (1) is smaller than the first character of ""2"" sort the second column with a ""numerical"" sort – that means smallest to largest number. for this case, ""2"" would be smaller than ""11"" and listed first. sort the third column, same rules as the second column (numerical aka ""n""). in practical terms, these methods will ""coordinate sort"" the first three columns of a bed file. most bioinformatics tools are designed to interpret chromosome positions this way for bed datasets. the rest of the line is not considered, just passed through the tool associated with whatever was originally included per line after the ""chrom-start-stop"" data. try different sort conditions on your data a few different ways, you will notice the difference. the tool form also has a few examples that should help to clear up why the command-line was written that way.

[INST] hi galaxy community, i am needing your help. when running snippy (toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/snippy/snippy/4.6.0+galaxy0) using a list of dataset pairs, ie paired reads grouped in a paired collection, the tool fails in some of the samples with the following message in the last line: --tmpdir '/var/lib/condor/execute/dir_3665157' is not a directory. the weird thing is that when i run it for the second time using the same samples in the same paired collection, some samples fail but they are different to the ones that failed in the previous run. that is no say apparently it has nothing to do with the samples as they fail randomly. additionally, i tried running the paired fastq files separately one by one, and snippy finishes successfully. do you have any clue about what could be going on? thanks!! sol [/INST] , found it. it is called 'replace elements in collection?'. set it to yes during re-run, and if the job completes, the output replaces the failed output in collection. hope this helps. , igor

[INST] i am trying to validate star-fusion for detecting gene fusions in rnaseq data and seem to have some problems in implementing the package through the http://usegalaxy.org server. the results with very clean tophat2 fusion validated reads were nothing like they were supposed to be. i posted a query on a star fusion bulletin board and got a response from the folks at broad institute who developed the package. they looked at what i did and got the correct answers. something is different in the program implementation and i would like to know how to do it correctly here is what i did: downloaded the ctat file grch37_v19_ctat_lib_feb092018.source_data.tar.gz at index of https://data.broadinstitute.org/trinity/ctat_resource_lib/) and undbundled the individual files. uploaded to the galaxy server @link http://usegalaxy.org/ ref_annot.cdna.allvsall.outfmt6.togenes.sorted ref_annot.gtf ref_genome.fa uploaded from ncbi by fastq-dump srr6796340 anaplastic large t-cell lymphoma expect npm1-alk chr5-chr2 srr6796341 anaplastic large t-cell lymphoma- technical replicate srr6796358 diffuse histiocytic lymphoma expect npm1-alk chr5-chr2 srr6796374 large cell immunoblastic lymphoma expect npm1-alk chr5-chr2 srr6796384 bladder transitional cell carcinoma expect fgfr3-tacc3 chr4-chr4 high counts srr6796352 chronic myeloid leukemia expect bcr-abl1 chr9-chr22 i ran rna star first then star-fusion or star-fusion in control of the rna star aligner program. the run parameters are below. rna star dataset information number: 87 name: rna star on data 51, data 53, and data 73: chimeric junctions created: sat dec 29 19:01:27 2018 (utc) filesize: 4.9 gb dbkey: ? format: interval job information galaxy tool id: toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/rgrnastar/rna_star/2.6.0b-1 galaxy tool version: 2.6.0b-1 tool version: tool standard output: stdout tool standard error: stderr tool exit code: 0 history content api id: bbd44e69cb8906b5b3d043534aebc71b job api id: bbd44e69cb8906b5f73bf7040b268a06 history api id: de36650321118931 uuid: 8fe466e2-9dee-48ca-91b4-b395c6757088 tool parameters input parameter value single-end or paired-end reads paired rna-seq fastq/fasta file, forward reads 73: srr6796352 (fastq-dump) rna-seq fastq/fasta file, reverse reads 73: srr6796352 (fastq-dump) custom or built-in reference genome history select a reference genome 53: ref_genome.fa gene model file for splice junctions 51: ref_annot.gtf length of the genomic sequence around annotated junctions 100 count number of reads per gene true would you like to set output parameters (formatting and filtering)? no other parameters (seed, alignment, limits and chimeric alignment) star_fusion job resource parameters no inheritance chain star-fusion dataset information number: 91 name: star-fusion on data 48, data 51, and others: fusion_candidates.final created: sat dec 29 21:47:32 2018 (utc) filesize: dbkey: ? format: tabular job information galaxy tool id: toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/star_fusion/star_fusion/0.5.4-3 galaxy tool version: 0.5.4-3 tool version: software version: star-fusion_v0.5.4 tool standard output: stdout tool standard error: stderr tool exit code: 0 history content api id: bbd44e69cb8906b569580af0b3b0f6c0 job api id: bbd44e69cb8906b539bb05ac571e27ea history api id: de36650321118931 uuid: 8426b56c-6591-4871-94eb-1e7f258e39ad tool parameters input parameter value use output from earlier star run or let star fusion control running star use_chimeric chimeric junction file from star star-fusion settings) 87: rna star on data 51, data 53, and data 73: chimeric junctions source for sequence to search history select the reference genome file) 53: ref_genome.fa gene model file for splice junctions and fusion gene detection 51: ref_annot.gtf result of blast±blastn of the reference fasta sequence with itself 48: ref_annot.cdna.allvsall.outfmt6.togenes.sorted settings to use default job resource parameters no either way the results were the same. none of the fusions listed were the correct ones and at most one fusion partner on the correct chromosome distant from the expected break point. what mystifies is that the people at the broad institute got the expected results what one would expect. when running rna star for linking to fusion, the star fusion instance on galaxy on the server it generates 4 output files, including one with the chimeric fusion junctions which i input into the star fusion run. is this the correct one to use? i noticed that the github star fusion tutorial instructions indicate downloading a mutation resource and then using something out of this zip folder. sounds like the versions of star-fusions are differently set up. this might be close to where the error is being generated. if you can figure out what i did wrong in setting this up i would greatly appreciate suggestions on how to fix it.

[INST] hi, i am a beginner in run galaxy. starting from this morning, my galaxy stopped to run, the jobs in the history say ""this job is waiting to run"" and this status has last for a couple of hours. anyone can tell me what i can do? i appreciate your help. [/INST] @link http://usegalaxy.org has a banner up explaining how the server resources will be allocated over the upcoming week why). jobs are expected to queue even when there is not an event going on. if the jobs do not move from queued (gray) to execute after 72 hours, then a rerun may help. just be aware that this removes the original job from the queue, and places the new job back at the end of the queue. if a server is busy, and many are, a rerun will result in even longer delays – or possibly never running if you keep deleting/rerunning before the jobs have a chance to be deployed to an executing stage. faq: how jobs execute (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/how-jobs-execute/) i also added a tag to your post that points to similar qa about the subject. in short, job queue times at public servers depend on a few factors: how busy the server is, how many concurrent jobs you have running (queued + executing), what kinds of tools are you running (some tools require more resources, and those cluster nodes are the busiest), … and special factors noted in banners (events, downtime, known server issues). for right now, i would suggest leaving the job as it is, to give it some time to move through the queue. or you can rerun as @system suggests, as it sounds like it has not been that long since you started it up and there was a small issue at http://usegalaxy.org earlier today although that resulted in job failures that required a rerun (resource allocation issues) not jobs stalling in queued status (what it seems your situation is). the choice is yours on how to proceed ps: for anyone participating in the gcc2021 training event, special queues will be set up to prioritize your tutorial work once the event starts. these particular queues will only be available to registered students and will have resources appropriate for training-sized data only work will fail for resource reasons). your event instructions will describe how to join these queues, and you can contact your instructors in slack should you need more help. non-event end-users will have their jobs sent the regular queues the servers support, and some may have extended queue times and related resource allocation changes – if those are in place, the server will note so in their banner.

[INST] hi. i am looking into a package in usegalaxy that can show my rnaseq data is stranded or unstranded. [/INST] , in order to know if your rnaseq datasets are stranded or unstranded, you need to align it against the reference genome; you can use rna star. then by using the bam/sam mapping stats tool, you can infer it by comparing the number of reads which map to positive and negative strand.

[INST] hi, i have run into a problem when trying to count features from a genomic alignment. i have used rna-star to align single end fastq data from the rabbit. the mapping goes well and delivers a good unique mapping of 74%. to then count features (using featurecounts) i use the same genome imported via ucsc table browser as ncbi-refseq-genome-all in gtf format. so far so good. at first inspection everything looks great, genes i expect highly represented are indeed so. however, one key gene i expected to be highly represented was missing from the counts and was given as being zero, something that seemed very odd. i converted the aligned bam from the rna-star output to a bigwig for ucsc import and could clearly see this gene should certainly be present in terms of transcript counts. i also examined my gtf file and could also confirm that all the exon locations and gene annotations were present as expected for this gene and all matched the gene_id locations for the observed bigwig output under ucsc. i proceeded to inspect other genes that according to the featurecount table were zero. many, were indeed zero, however, i came across many entries that were clearly not zero according to the aligned bigwig. since i previously came across this issue (by chance) when performing a mouse rna-seq experiment (but at the time just disregarded it a a 'glitch'), i am now more concerned. i have inspected all the files and inputs i am using but as for myself, can find no good explanation for this output mismatch. any ideas? , phil [/INST] @quote to then count features (using featurecounts) i use the same genome imported via ucsc table browser as ncbi-refseq-genome-all in gtf format. retrieving gtfs from the ucsc table browser can introduce two problems. ucsc explains about why not to get gtfs using the tb on their site but sometimes that is missed. the gene_id and transcript_id values will be the same value (scientific problem wherever it is used, and probably explains the odd results) the output can be truncated due to output size limits (technical problem once in galaxy) you did not state which genome you are using, but check in their downloads area for gtf annotation. if your genome does not have this already available, write into ucsc's help and they can assist you to get a proper file. galaxy training network (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/datasets_working_with_reference_annotation.html) galaxy training: working with gff gft gtf2 gff3 reference annotation (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/datasets_working_with_reference_annotation.html) collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the w...

[INST] hello, so yesterday i was able to use stringtie to get gene and transcript counts from my aligned bam files with no issues. today i tried to run new samples and i was able to get assembled transcripts but no counts. i figured this was an issue with my new files. so i took the files that worked perfectly yesterday and ran stringtie on them again (same settings, files, etc.) and now these are also not outputting any counts. i am honestly stumped on this one and not sure if it is just an issue with the site at this point. any advice would greatly help my sanity. thank you. [/INST] hi stephen, i am sorry for the confusing explanation. with the default settings stringtie only produces a gene annotation file. it can produce count and abundance files, as additional outputs. for example, you can enable output of abundance estimation files, as in your reply. to get counts, try gene annotation in your history, and change output files for differential expression? to deseq2/edger/limma-voom. for counting i use dedicated tools, such as featurecounts. , igor

[INST] hi, new galaxy user, so just getting used to it. i was trying to upload a fastq file of 300mb, uploaded it using the ftp and everything went smoothly but, the file has been charging for two hours now to the server. it stills with the clock and in grey. in your experience, it takes so long for large files to be uploaded? should i re-load the charging? thank you very much for your help. best, eva sandoval. [/INST] welcome, few questions: did you check that the file was completely loaded during the ftp step before you attempted to move it into the history using the upload tool? whatever method you used (ex: client such as filezilla or lftp line-command) produces statistics or a message confirming a complete/successful transfer. are you working at https://usegalaxy.org (just to double-check) 300 mb is not that large of a file. and the upload process to move the dataset into a history should happen quickly. the server is a bit slow right now, so this could be a problem on our end. more feedback soon. but please confirm the questions if you have time, just to make sure we are working on solving the same problem. update: we addressed the slower response times at http://usegalaxy.org. your job for the data transfer ftp upload history should have completed by now.

[INST] another quality control question. i trimmed my datasets of interest with trim galore! after this, i ran fastqc to check if the removal of adapter and primer sequences was successful. while, based on the adapter content plot, the adapters were removed successfully during trimming, i still had some overrepresented sequences in some datasets: image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/f/f9455004384495861dc154ffefb1bbc0b6bc6581.png) however, since there were no hits to indicate what these were, i copied them into a fasta file and ran them using the ncbi blast blastn tool against the locally installed blast databases. the output of this was the following: image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/c/ce7a3dcc7dd0ae0895c01f6be9bd4eead144aa46.png) the reads matched whole genome sequencing contigs across multiple species (predominantly, mammalians). what i am wondering now is how to interpret this - are these overrepresented sequences mapping to some potentially conserved sequences across species and are overall false positive (in terms of not being a contaminating adapter, primer, etc.) or if it is something else? if they match to innocent sequences, can i ignore the overrepresented sequences when running downstream analyses? the reads i am investigating are short bp), so i would assume they have higher chances of matching something broadly than longer reads. they are also from rnaseq experiments (i read that sequences flagged as overrepresented can sometimes indicate highly expressed genes). would appreciate your opinions and advice. thanks! [/INST] @quote if they match to innocent sequences, can i ignore the overrepresented sequences when running downstream analyses? one thing that i usually try is to review regions like that in the ucsc genome browser https://genome.ucsc.edu/. also just googled them, and tried at ncbi, etc). sometimes you will not find out but can always check to see if they at least fall out during read mapping against a genome/transcriptome later on or not. public wgs data is much ""noisier"" and sometimes the age of the sequence submissions and sequencing protocols are clues, too. i tend to try to blat map the ""mystery sequence"" to a well annotated model organism (sometimes a few, if i do not get hits with the first), then click into the hit and view it in the genome alignment view. consider scrolling down and turning on more tracks to suit what seems relevant to make a decision. i usually start with the comparative genomics → conservation track plus everything in the variation and repeats section along with the existing defaults since all those combined provide basic annotation markers for the hit region regions – which can also be informative). the rest is a judgement call happy hunting!

[INST] hello, i am doing a de novo assembly with trinity. it was running for 14 days and then ended with no error (the job box is green), but both the assembly and the gene to transcripts map are empty bytes). the only ""error"" i see in the output is this: sequence: ccaatattaagccacgattaaggais smaller than 25 base pairs, skipping repeating for a bunch of sequences, and nothing else. the input files are paired-end, rf stranded, trimmomatic output files, not interleaved. i used them for assembly with trinity in the same history almost a year ago, and everything worked perfectly. does anyone have an idea as to what could be causing this? thanks! [/INST] @quote the only difference in this run is that i put all of my samples for one assembly instead of separating them into two different assemblies like the last time. that comes up to around of 500m reads, so it could be, as you say, that the job was too large. thanks for explaining. combining more reads into a single assembly can definitely impact runtime and performance. 500m reads in the same assembly is about 10 times the size of datasets the authors used for benchmarking statistics: trinity memory usage (@link https://trinityrnaseq.github.io/performance/mem.html). assembly can be impacted for scientific content reasons (depth, coverage, redundancy) – but i do not think that is the root issue right now. the issue is simply volume versus resources. what i would suggest is to consider downsampling the reads before assembly. one tool choice is sektk. that way you can include all samples together but not run up against computational issues. there is much discussion about assembly strategies at the different bioinformatics forums, including here: @link https://groups.google.com/g/trinityrnaseq-users. @quote could you please also tell me how to start a private chat to share my history? i will start up a direct message. but i do not think that reviewing your history right now will change the advice. it sounds like the reads are in the correct technical format, can pass through qa steps, and will assemble when in a smaller batch. at this forum, a new user's trust level will increase with time and activity, and the option to start up a direct message will become available. the goal is to try to keep initial questions and general discussion/troubleshooting public. this helps us to build up the knowledge base and helps you to reach more potential helpers :slight_smile:

[INST] what does this error mean? ncol(countdata) nrow(coldata) is not true [/INST] hi - thanks for the extra information! the problem is with the format of the count input datasets. each sample needs to be run through a supported count tool and entered individually under factor/factor levels. details are on the deseq2 tool form. since your data has the counts in a matrix, that will not work with deseq2 as currently wrapped for galaxy. options: to use deseq2, i would suggest generating the counts within galaxy. or, you could run one of your samples in galaxy, compare those results to your per-sample counts generated outside of galaxy (individual counts, before merged into a matrix), and make changes to sync up the formatting as needed. consider alternative tools. limma/edger do support count matrix input. how to use each is described on their tools forms with example data input content/format. limma de (with matrix input) is included in this provisional galaxy training network tutorial: @link https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-counts-to-genes/tutorial.html note: at this time, that tutorial still under development. once the tutorial finalized, it will be listed here: @link https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/. feedback to the gtn about it would be welcomed to help us improve it – find the feedback form at the end of the tutorial. if you want to use all the tools in the tutorial, those might not be all at galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org server yet – but i am fairly certain the tools are at galaxy eu https://usegalaxy.eu server server used for development of the tutorial) – and if not for some reason, that could be part of your feedback.

[INST] hi all, i trimmed my paired datasets for adapters using cutadapt. however, the output of the cutadapt is not visible if i want to run hisat2 subsequently. rna star can easily use detect cutadapt datasets for further processing. i can circumvent this problem by generating a new list of dataset pairs, but i assume there must be a faster way, because, when building a new list of dataset pairs, i also need to edit the pair name in order to keep a better overview further down the pipeline. am i overlooking something? [/INST] update 4/22/21 re-tested with the prior test, plus created a new extracted workflow and reran that. everything is working. i had forgotten that cutadapt will split a paired-end collection into two collections: one contains the forward reads, and one contains the reverse reads. maybe this is the problem you had? and this example usage will help you to sort out the problems you were having? the end result from hisat2 is a single collection. the data is a bit large in the history, but you do not need to actually import it use the function, all the details are available. the workflow is very simple and does not consume any extra quota space, so importing and perhaps using it or reviewing it in the editor will help even more. you will see that a single collection of paired-end reads was input to cutadapt, then resulting collections of the forward and reverse reads were input to hisat2, producing one final collection of mapped bams (one per pair). history: @link https://usegalaxy.org/you/jen-galaxyproject/h/copy-of-test-cutadapt-listpaired--hisat2 workflow: galaxy accessible workflow workflow constructed from history 'copy of'test cutadapt listpaired'+ hisat2' (@link https://usegalaxy.org/you/jen-galaxyproject/w/workflow-constructed-from-history-copy-of-test-cutadapt-listpaired--hisat2) @quote however, the output of the cutadapt is not visible if i want to run hisat2 subsequently. rna star can easily use detect cutadapt datasets for further processing. the data is in a paired-end dataset collection with the datasets inside it assigned the datatype fastqsanger.gz, correct? the output from cutadapt? hisat2 should be able to recognize that dataset collection and process it directly. the collection should be in the active history, with this option set on the hisat2 tool form. note: the screenshot is from loading the tool with a new, empty history that does not contain inputs of the proper datatype. it is a good way of discovering what the appropriate/recognized inputs are. when you run this, the input should be populated with one or more paired collections assigned one of those specified datatypes. compressed will be recognized and uncompressed automatically as part of the pre-processing. hisat (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/9/9f944ed01d5a212f5756e838d8e756161b00720a.png) if you do not get a result like that, something is going wrong, and we can follow up on that. rebuilding the collection or unhiding collection elements should not be needed (although they both are valid workarounds for this problem!). let us try to fix it at the source. cutadapt had some issues with workflows in the past – but am pretty sure those are resolved now (most current galaxy release + most current tool version). few questions: where are you using galaxy? url if a public server. and are you using the most current tool versions available there? we can follow up from there – an example might be good to review not publically) – if needed, we will explain how. if you own galaxy cloud), are you upgraded to the latest galaxy version? are the tools updated from the toolshed? has this worked before or it is a new problem? if using a workflow, did this stop working after changes (not necessarily these steps)? you might even want to check to see if some sample of this works at one or any of the usegalaxy.* servers (as a comparison). let us start there. this was an issue before, so seems odd to have it come up again. i will also review/rerun our prior test cases at http://usegalaxy.org and will write back with that result. thanks!

[INST] hi galaxians. i have obtained illumina paired-end reads of microbiome metagenomes from a human sample and would now like to remove human (contaminant) sequences from them. i have tried installing bowtie2 on anaconda but did not get very far as i am new to anaconda and bowtie2. i found some instructions at this link (@link https://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/short-read/remove-host-sequences) for doing this but sadly, i do not know how to implement it. is it possible to add this function to bowtie2 in galaxy? or is there a tool in galaxy that can perform a similar function? thank you in advance for your help. [/INST] there is removal of human reads from sars-cov-2 sequencing data (@link https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/human-reads-removal/tutorial.html). it is demonstarting things with sars-cov-2 sequencing reads, but try to work through it and it should be rather obvious how to apply this to your data, i hope.

[INST] i have tried to run rna star with mus_musculus.grcm39.108.gtf.gz as input for model file for splice junctions"" and it gives error. interestingly i can run rna star with gencode.vm10.annotation.gtf.gz as input for model file for splice junctions"" successfully. however, tools like annotate id gives an error and gene ids can not be converted to gene symbols. please can someone help me with this. thanks. [/INST] @user what reference genome do you use for mapping? gencode.vm10 is for grcm38 - see gencode - mouse release m10 (@link https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_m10.html), while mus_musculus.grcm39.108.gtf.gz is for grcm39 assembly. precomputed mm39 index is not available on @link http://usegalaxy.org or @link http://usegalaxy.org.au. do you use galaxy europe? star jobs can fail for several reasons, and without looking into the input files and job settings i can only guess. other common issues are different chromosome names in reference genome and annotation. genomes in galaxy use style"" chromosome names (chr1, chr2 etc), while some annotations use 1, 2, etc. these are different text strings. if you use a custom mm39 genome in the history, star jobs might fail because of insufficient memory. i assume you mean annotatemyid. i tested it on a count table made using an old gencode annotation vm4. the annotation is for mm10/grcm38. in the count table ensembl genes names contain versions (.1, .2 etc), while example of input file in the tool description does not have versions. i stripped versions in the count table by replacing dots with tabular character, basically, split the 1st column into two. this makes the gene names compatible with annotatemyids. no such issue if you use non-default settings, such as gene_name for gene identifier, just change input type in annotatemyid to symbol. , igor

[INST] hello team, i would like to bring to your notice that the command rna star is not running and the status says ""this job is waiting to run"" for almost 18 hours by now. how can i fix this? thanks [/INST] for the jobs at http://usegalaxy.org: when working at any public galaxy server, you are using a shared resource. that means that some of your jobs will run, then some of other people's jobs will run, then more of yours, repeat. during the training last week, all servers had extra limits on concurrent jobs plus the usegalaxy.* servers overall were very busy. this week everything is back to normal but still busy, and processing a large number of jobs will still take time. for the rna star jobs that already failed, that is due to an input problem. the reference gtf used is labeled with ensembl chromosome names. the built-in rn5 index is sourced from ucsc and uses a different chromosome naming format/label. the mismatch triggers a failure. try using a gtf from ucsc instead. the qa below discusses where to get a human reference annotation in gtf format, but the url to the rat annotation is similar (replace ""hg38"" with ""rn5""). the same is true for every genome with an annotation track that is hosted by ucsc and indexed in galaxy. @quote thehg38reference annotationgtfis now best sourced from ucsc. not from the table browser but from thedownloads area here. there are a few gene tracks to choose from. you can review what each of those represents then upload the selectedgtfto galaxy with theuploadtool. just copy and paste in the url and leave all other settings at the default. the correct datatype will be assigned. the solution is get the correct gtf into galaxy rerun all of your jobs using that gtf instead those new jobs will execute as resources become available. the jobs already queued up will also fail, so be sure to purge those to clear them from your queue. hope that helps!

[INST] hello, i uploaded files in galaxy with sra accesion list. it created 2 files: single-end (fastq-dump) and paired-end (fastq-dump). my workflow accepted single-end (fastq-dump) however galaxy does not recognize the fastq-dump for paired-end as a collection. i assumed that is because of the batch mode file. now, i am trying to separate the forward and the reverse reads and create two separated collection. i cannot find any function that would help me manipulate the fastq-dump. (fastq splitter was a disappointment). any hints where they might hide? [/INST] the ""type"" of the dataset collection created will matter for the data to show up on an input field, as well as the ""datatype"" of the data inside the collection, and the ""content"" of that data inside each dataset part does not have a distinct metadata attribute – could be forward fastq reads, reverse fastq reads, or interlaced forward/reverse fastq reads). collections are built up from those to create four options. many options … but maybe the explaination below will help. hisat2 four different content inputs variations are possible three can be given as one of three different dataset types: individual files, multiple individual files, or a dataset collection that fits the overall entry type. one can be only given as a dataset collection (item 3 below). that translates to 10 different choices, just for the fastq input. screenshots, then i will explain what each can contain: the four input types for this tool (many will only have the first three but expect that to evolve over time as interlaced inputs are added to more tools): input-content.png (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/37e2820946644e235811cb840f78ef371595a343.png) the tool form changes dynamically based on the choice made. the three dataset types available for the first two and the last from the list above are in the screenshots below. the declared ""collection"" will only accept a paired-end collection (so, you will not see the options below for it - a collection is already expected). one-indiv-dataset-input multiple-indiv-dataset-input one-collection-input where: single-end: single end sequences in each original individual dataset. those can be entered as individual datasets, or selected as multiple datasets, or be put in a ""list"" type of dataset collection. paired-end: paired-end sequences, forward in an original individual dataset and reverse in an original individual dataset. those can be entered as individual datasets, or selected as multiple datasets, or be put into two distinct type of dataset collections. one list for the forward, one list for the reverse. paired-end dataset collection: paired-end sequences, forward and reverse added to a dataset collection that contains one pair of f/r reads or a combined ""list of pairs"" if you have more than one pair. the collection is created from data that has the forward reads in one or more datasets originally, each with a matching reverse read dataset). paired-end data from single interleaved dataset: paired-end sequences, forward and reverse interleaved in an individual dataset (this is what you had/have, before ""de-interlacing""). those can be entered as individual datasets, or selected as multiple datasets, or be put in a ""list"" type of dataset collection. hope that helps!

[INST] hay, i am trying to extact genomic dna out of a fasta file and a flanked vcf file. i have a vcf file and a fasta file and i want to exctact the snp's with 200 bp flanks. first i uploaded my fasta one is tab delimited) and my vcf file. i transformed my vcf file to a pgsnp file and then get flanks with ""get flanks returns flanking region/s for every gene"". then i used extract genomic dna for getting te sequences. but the output i get is totally empty and says ""unable to fetch the sequence"". i hope someone is able to help me. , ilse [/INST] , extract genomic dna expects two inputs. if the formatting or content is off for either, you will not get valid results. query: genomic coordinates in bed or gtf format. the tool states interval format as a valid input, which is a less strict format datatype version than bed. even so, the data must have bed column format/ordering for at least the first 3-6 columns columns if including strand). the tool also states gff format as a valid input, which is a less strict format datatype version than gtf. this means that the 9th column (attributes) does need to include the stricter minimum values and transcript_id). do not use a gff3 input or expect errors. using vcf to pgsnp is fine. the first four columns of data are in interval format, and if you use cut to restrict to the first four columns the data will then be in bed format. but using get flanks will also restrict the output to be in interval format with bed column ordering. target: a locally-cached index on the server or a custom genome in fasta format. to use a ""locally-cached"" genome, that genome must be assigned as the metadata to the query input. to use a use custom genome, you might need to run normalizefasta on your fasta to remove the description line content (data on the title line after the first whitespace) and wrap the bases to a consistent length (80 is good). the tool will only be able to interpret data that is actually in fasta format, not tabular. transform with tabular-to-fasta, if you need to, first. also, check your data for chromosome/identifier naming mismatches. between the two inputs, the ""chromosome"" names must be formatted exactly the same and the overall content based on the same reference genome/transcriptome version/build. this means that the identifiers in the first column of your interval/bed dataset must exactly match what is on the title line of the fasta dataset. the faqs below have more details: faqs: https://galaxyproject.org/support/ format help for tabular/bed/interval datasets (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/tabular/) common datatypes explained https://galaxyproject.org/learn/datatypes/) the tool i am using does not recognize any input datasets. why? https://galaxyproject.org/support/datatypes-and-tools/) how do i find, adjust, and/or correct metadata? https://galaxyproject.org/support/metadata/) preparing and using a custom reference genome or build (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/custom-genomes/) mismatched chromosome identifiers (and how to avoid them) https://galaxyproject.org/support/chrom-identifiers/) hope that helps, but if not, share some more details. you could copy/paste the first few lines of both inputs and/or post back screenshots in a reply. make sure to expand the datasets to show the currently assigned datatypes or state exactly what those are for each.

[INST] i am trying to recover a fasta file from a blast search run in galaxy but blastdbcmd does not recognize the database. i made the blast database with makeblastdb in galaxy and i have tried it with and without parse_seq_ids - it is not recognized as a database either way.

[/INST] dependency resolution with conda is now the default and recommended method for tool installation. start here: @link https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/dependency_resolvers.html @link https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/conda_faq.html the versions of galaxy noted are over a year old – use the latest versions of galaxy releases for the best functionality. you will find that the dependency resolution functions are no longer in beta and can be customized. using default settings is generally best unless you have specific reasons to install differently. the links above cover the options. if you need help with a docker version of galaxy, this gitter chat is a direct way to communicate with the image maintainers: https://gitter.i am/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable the galaxy test toolshed https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ is a testing sandbox meaning, tools are not in a stable/release form. obtain tools from the galaxy main toolshed https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ instead. if a tool is only available in the test toolshed, and not in the main toolshed, it may still be useable, but installation may not work ""automatically"" and require some advanced tuning. explore the development repository for the tool usually linked to the tool's toolshed page, but not required, especially at the test toolshed), review open known issues, and open a new issue there describing problems as needed. the tool wrapper authors are the best resource for troubleshooting installation issues (if using managed dependencies and the most current version of galaxy itself). an exception can be tool wrappers authored by the iuc or devteam – you can ask if there are known issues (if you cannot find one yet at the development repository) or for installation help (after reviewing the development docs linked above) at this gitter chat: @link https://gitter.i am/galaxy-iuc/iuc please be aware that some tools may no longer be actively maintained, and some may use older or custom dependency resolution methods. toolsheds are community resources – anyone can publish a tool there. how to tell if a tool is maintained/functional or requires a specific installation method? 1) the tool wrapper's publication date, how many times downloaded, and other notes on the tool's toolshed page and 2) commit/update dates at the linked development repository. the test and main toolsheds were just upgraded, so there were recently windows where tool installation was expected to not function correctly, no matter which toolshed was the source. example qa about that at this gitter chat: @link https://gitter.i am/galaxyproject/dev?at=5f59fa68a5788a3c29e651a5 current and historical status/notes about downtime are at the galaxy status page. it includes all usegalaxy.* servers and core resources like toolsheds. @link https://galaxyproject.statuspage.io/ hope that helps!

[INST] hello, i got a local instance of galaxy on my computer, and wanted to run a differential expression analysis for some samples of human rna-seq data. i have managed to download the fastq reads for the samples and i have downloaded and indexed the human genome using hisat2 index builder. but when i tried to align the reads from just one of the six files, it was not able to align them in almost 60 hours of running. so i decided that i would need to do this on the cloud. however, i do not want to have to reinstall the tools, and re-download all the files and re-index the genome. i was wondering if there was any way to take whatever i have on my computer, and put it onto the cloud as is, so that i can pick up where i left off. thank you [/INST] it is not possible to transfer a local setup to cloudman/gvl and instead the tools would needs to be installed again. the gvl does come with a number of tools pre-installed, so perhaps the tools are already available, or maybe only a couple of them would need to be installed. it also comes with a bunch of reference data so hopefully that would not need to be setup. an alternative you could perhaps try is to use the galaxycloudrunner: @link https://galaxycloudrunner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ this is still under development (you would likely be the first user), but in principle, it allows you to connect additional cloud machines to your local galaxy instance. the remote instance will generally be automatically setup for the necessary tools at runtime while it will transfer the data automatically.

[INST] hi everyone, we recently installed the galaxy server to our mainframe. however, we are having difficulty in using rna star as there is no reference genome available (see attached picture). how can we rectify this? https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/9/9ac0b619ac8075cf51693b5be23a7c0e7842f99a.png) many thanks, chris [/INST] the slides that @system shared are part of a larger tutorial suite. admin topics are here: galaxy training network (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/) galaxy training: galaxy server administration (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/) resources related to configuration and maintenance of gal... review the section management reference data"". in short, you have several choices for the method. these include: create your own indexes using data managers. these are like other tools galaxy, but only available for local server admins. you would need to install the tools, then access them under the tab, then either run the tools in a specific order directly or use our batch processing utility. link in or copy of the indexes available at public galaxy servers from our data server. this would be configured by a local admin. human genome builds are included. the how-to is covered in the tutorials and some include videos. i also added a few tags to your post that cover prior qa about this topic (troubleshooting, etc). if you get stuck or have problems, feel free to ask more questions. @quote we just simply want to add the reference genome (human) with built-in index and without the built-in gene model each genome build is associated with the genome fasta and several technical indexes. some optional, some required. example: items like the samtools index would be needed to interpret bam outputs produced by mapping tools. and tool specific indexes (including rna-star for most). having a built-in indexes is different from using a custom genome/build where just the fasta is add to the working history. why? galaxy creates those technical and tool specific indexes at runtime as single-use temporary files. custom genomes/builds are fine for smaller genomes (or any ""-ome"") but larger genomes would require much more time/resources to create those indexes every time the tool is run. convenient for some use cases but not practical for others. for human, definitely use a built-in indexes. and if you chose to use the pre-computed indexes we host, you will not need to scale up your local resources to create the indexes with data managers. you will still need to have sufficient resources to execute a tool. for `rna-star, i think the minimum working memory would be about 60 gb – but you can check with your own data. run the tool at a public server with a representative dataset query and against a genome build target, click into the job details (:information_source: icon within the result dataset), and review the resources used in the lower part of the report. hope that helps!

[INST] hi, i have been trying to run snpeff in galaxy, but have been facing a number of issues that i am not sure how to resolve. background: i am analysis different strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. i have created a vcf file, and would now like to see the effects of my variants, hence i am using snpeff. problems: when i use the snpeff download tool to download the snpeff database for mycobacterium_tuberculosis_h37rv, the tool runs successfully but outputs a file with only 2 lines. (snpeff version number and mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv). i tried using the snpeff build tool as well with the genbank annotation file, however it results in the same 2 line output. because of this problem, i directly downloaded the snpeff database from sourceforge, and uploaded the file as a snpeffdb to galaxy. this file however, shows as 'unavailable' in snpeff eff. the issue might be with the metadata, which i am not able to edit manually and autodetect does not work. as you can see i have tried all the approaches i can think of and nothing seems to work. i even used the http://galaxy.eu version. please help, i am new to ngs analysis and will appreciate any guidance. @system @system [/INST] hmm, from your description (which is very detailed by the way - thanks for that!) there does not seem to be anything wrong here. those two lines of output are how galaxy presents the newly downloaded genome to you. after all, snpeff genome files are kept in a binary format and there is not really a more helpful way to display that data. what you should try next is to go to the snpeff eff tool, select downloaded snpeff database in your history under genome source, and the version you downloaded via snpeff download should be offered as a choice. building the genome file yourself should also work, but is not recommended if there is an exisitng genome for download. such genomes should be offered if you select custom snpeff database in your history as the genome source. uploading an externally built snpeff genome to a galaxy history is not currently supported. let us know if you keep facing issues and best wishes, wolfgang

[INST] wondering if anyone could give a bit of advice on my situation. i have rnqseq ngs data for 6 different human cell lines. each has a normal and a stressed condition. i have featurecounts for each of those that are the summation of the replicates, so 12 summary count files. i have successfully compared each matching line stressed-normal but was wondering if there was a simple way to visualize possible significant genes when comparing each line to another (eg: instead of just line1 stressed vs line1 normal, i could easily plot all of the top 20 or so genes of significance by logfc and visualize overlaps that may exist between line1 normal and any of the other lines, line1 normal to line3 normal. one large multi-colored plot type? instead of running limma on each possible comparison possible pairwise comparisons, which would be a crazy amount of data to then manually try to find overlaps within). we are looking for some very early preliminary hints as to comparisons between these lines with regard to up and down regulated similarities. would obviously dig into individual comparisons in a different way after but was hoping to some sort of visualization plot method without having to run each comparison individually and then seeking out common top genes that overlap. hope that makes sense. tried to solve this for myself prior to asking here. [/INST] are you after a heatmap style plot or interactive representation? please check limma-voom report (dataset #16) in this history: galaxy australia | accessible history rna-seq-2 https://usegalaxy.org.au/you/igor/h/rna-seq-2) the input was six conditions, two replicates each, but only two contrasts were used comparisons). scroll down and check heatmap output and glimma interactive mdplot. click on any de gene on the interactive plot to see expression in other conditions. are you after something like this? the original tutorial: 2: rna-seq counts to genes (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-counts-to-genes/tutorial.html) , igor

[INST] hi there! i have been running differential expression analysis on a lot of datasets and i have been computing z scores to identify significant genes for a few weeks now and everything was working fine when suddenly, no matter what tool i use (deseq, hisat2, table compute, filter etc), it gives me the same error: condor_submit failed. i have been using the same inputs for weeks now with no issue. the error occurred when i was calculating z scores from a normalised counts file (which i had done literally 10 seconds earlier with the same inputs, working just fine). any idea what is happening? [/INST] we had a temporary issue on http://usegalaxy.eu yesterday, which resulted in this error for all new jobs over maybe half an hour, or so. if you have not done so yet, you can now rerun each of your failed jobs and they should complete as expected again.

[INST] hi all, i am a beginner into rna-seq data analysis and was wondering if someone could explain what exactly the 'specify strand information' setting from the featurecounts tool is doing. for my pair-end rna-seq data analysis i am following the workflow as per this tutorial (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html). by the way, i am performing this analysis for data (biological triplicates) generated under 3 experimental conditions a, b and c. so total 9 files. after estimation of the strandedness (using the infer experiment tool) of my pair-end rna-seq data alignments i find that my libraries are reverse stranded (i.e. on average for all files ""1±,1-+,2++,2–"": 0.9670). does it mean that for featurecounts i need to 'specify strand information' as stranded (reverse)? i have tried both combinations of stranded (forward) and stranded (reverse) with the idea that i do not want to miss out on read counts that originated from overlapping but opposite strand genes or the antisense strand of non-overlapping genes i.e. antisense strand where there are no annotated features yet on the target genome thereby 'discovering' potential new transcribed regions. i then created 3 dataset collections as:  counts' - containing forward and reverse count files (total 18 tabular datasets) for each sample (a, b and c).  forward counts' - containing only forward count files (total 9 tabular datasets) for each sample (a, b and c).  reverse counts' - containing only reverse count files (total 9 tabular datasets) for each sample (a, b and c). subsequently, i extracted identifiers and tagged all files from all 3 dataset collections accordingly. i then performed deseq2, filtered out genes (2-fold change and adjusted p-value0.05). i now have 3 dataset collections each containing filtered lists (a vs b, a vs c and b vs c) i.e. degs from considering  counts',  forward counts' and  reverse counts'. my main question is, which of these would be the correct collection to refer to? would it be only the collection of lists obtained from considering the  reverse counts' count files? i would like to thank you very much in advance for your time, efforts and patience in answering my questions. . [/INST] @quote i am a beginner into rna-seq data analysis and was wondering if someone could explain what exactly the 'specify strand information' setting from the featurecounts tool is doing. setting the stand filters which mapped read will be counted up per annotation feature. reads map to a genomic regions with strand assigned during mapping (bam). features are placed on genomic regions with strand assigned in reference annotation gff3, or the built in indexes). featurecounts compares the two, and counts up reads-per-feature at the gene summary level. @quote after estimation of the strandedness (using the infer experiment tool) of my pair-end rna-seq data alignments i find that my libraries are reverse stranded (i.e. on average for all files ""1±,1-+,2++,2–"": 0.9670). does it mean that for featurecounts i need to 'specify strand information' as stranded (reverse)? if your data is stranded, then you should use stranded protocols for both mapping and counting. why? the sequencing chemistry protocol was designed to produce stranded reads. any reads mapped or counted on the opposite strand are non-specific. that can create a lot of noise in the results, and valid results could be omitted due to the over-counting. @quote my main question is, which of these would be the correct collection to refer to? would it be only the collection of lists obtained from considering the  reverse counts' count files? yes, those would be the results to consider. featurecounts produces graphs describing which reads could be assigned to a feature with specificity, and when not, the reason why. maybe examine those reports to see if you can confirm they produce the results? @quote i have tried both combinations of stranded (forward) and stranded (reverse) with the idea that i do not want to miss out on read counts that originated from overlapping but opposite strand genes or the antisense strand of non-overlapping genes i.e. antisense strand where there are no annotated features yet on the target genome thereby 'discovering' potential new transcribed regions. for this purpose, salmon, sailfish and kallisto are some choices for transcriptome-based discovery analysis.

[INST] hey, i encountered an issue: i was working on galaxy (@link http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) and trying to run lefse but the output files were different when i changed the way microorganisms are named. here is everything that i know: the dataset is green, the job did not fail. the lef_usual.txt is a input file whose first column contained many names of microorganisms, and these names had some special characters like ""()"", ""-"" and ""'"", like ""clostridium_sp._dl-viii"". the lef_usual_result.svg is the output file. there are 5 biomarkers for ""menorchild"". then, i replaced all the names of microorganisms in the first column in lef_usual.txt with another way of naming, such as s1, s2 and s3. the new input file was named lef_number.txt. the lef_number_result.svg is the new output file. there are 11 biomarkers for ""menorchild"". the relevant parameters of the two tasks are the same, only the naming method of the first column of the input file has changed. so, why does just changing the way microorganisms are named affect the final results? what format of naming will give the most correct results? the process screenshots, input files and output files have been uploaded. lef_number (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/9/91fa9fda29893aa7cab89bad0edb31f24e1f4597.png) lef_number_result (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/e/eb92bc975a6dd198107d654f68b3d1df45cc3b32.png) lef_usual (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/c/cdca97ad08002bf2849140e109dbc7455976a939.png) lef_usual_result (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/7/7724835daa1efcf7ceba50a66452195b6225b88b.png) process (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/f/f0353216d18ea73995870df00b06d3e226f65b5a.jpeg) [/INST] cross-posted here: the way microorganisms are named affect the final results of lefse (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/the-way-microorganisms-are-named-affect-the-final-results-of-lefse/8337)

[INST] hi, i have rnaseq data total rna) from whole blood rna of covid19 patients. based on ddpcr, i think some have detectable virus in blood. the alignment to hg38 using hisat2 is great, but when i substitute the sars-cov2 genome, i get very few alignments and it does not change between controls and covids, giving maybe 50 alignments out of 17m paired end reads. any ideas on what could be wrong, or a source for a workflow? many thanks, tim [/INST] if you are just interested in potential sars-cov-2 sequences, i would not recommend hisat2 necessarily, at least not as the only tool. options i would explore instead: do one pass of hisat2 alignment, then filter for unmapped reads and align those using bwa-mem bowtie2) generate a combined human/sars-cov-2 fasta, then use bwa-mem (or bowtie2) for a single round of alignment, after which you filter for alignments to the viral genome galaxy europe | published history | sars-cov-2/human combined ont reference https://usegalaxy.eu/you/wolfgang-maier/h/sars-cov-2human-combined-ont-reference) is an example history for generating the combined genome. you can import it and use it as your starting point, but since your data is illumina data (not ont), you would want to concatenate only the hg38 and the nc_045512.2 fasta datasets. here is a workflow that illustrates the approach for ont data and uses minimap2 as the mapper: galaxy europe | published workflow | sars-cov-2: map ont reads to transcripts (@link https://usegalaxy.eu/you/wolfgang-maier/w/sars-cov-2-assign-ont-reads-to-transcripts-mapping) it should not be hard to modify it for your use case. the rational behind these recommendations: hisat2 is a great tool for aligning eukaryotic spliced rna reads, but it is not optimized for viral rna. a general mapper (like bwa-mem or bowtie2) is sufficient for the viral data and may do a better job in fact. my first suggestion might be the best way to get optimal sensitivity for human and viral reads, but the second option should be very comparable (or even more sensitive) if you care about the viral reads only will do a good enough job of getting the vast majority of human reads out of the way and will discover sars-cov-2 alignments reliably).

[/INST] welcome, i took a look at one of your datasets mapped with both tools versus different tools that count up ""reads"" (and sometimes ""alignment lines"" instead!). fastq groomer total seqs in the input fastq dataset reported: 2182610 fastqc total sequences in the input fastq dataset reported: 2182610 total sequences in hisat2 result bam (sorted): 2509206 total sequences in bowtie result sam (unsorted): 4345310 total sequences in bowtie result sam converted with sam-to-bam to a bam (sorted): 4345310 samtools stats total ""raw total sequences"" in hisat2 result bam (sorted): 2182610 total ""raw total sequences"" in bowtie result sam (unsorted): 4345310 total ""raw total sequences"" in bowtie result sam converted with sam-to-bam to a bam (sorted): 4345310 hisat2 total input reads reported the built-in mapping stats: 2182610 bowtie no built-in stats for this older tool line/word/character count some plain data manipulation to prepare first: convert bam-to-sam or sam-to-fastq or fastq-to-tabular, remove any headers with select, and count the alignment lines. then cut out the reads names column) and finally get the unique occurrences of each record. this is certainly a more complicated way to do the counts but is the ""truth"" of the content and can work on any data, with the right prep manipulations, if you are ever unsure about what is going on with a particular tool. manipulating data this way does not rely on special tools to interpret metadata/flags in non-obvious ways – plus you can compare raw text data counts to those from other tools to get a better idea about what those may be actually counting up. total ""unique reads"" in original fastq (dataset 322 hidden, contained in collection dataset 323 as first dataset): 2182610 total ""alignment lines"" in hisat2 result bam: 2509206 total ""unique reads"" in hisat2 result bam: 2182610 total ""alignment lines"" in bowtie result sam: 4345310 total ""unique reads"" in bowtie result sam: 2182610 in summary, each reported alignment line or fastq entry bam, sam) is being counted up by some tools (including, in some cases, duplicated reported reads) and others are counting up true unique reads/sequences. this is unfortunate but expected, and part of the reason the updated mapping tools (including bowtie2) produce native tool mapping stats plus output sorted/better annotated bams by default. hope that helps, both to help make sense your data and to definitively confirm that all original reads were mapped by both tools. there are probably a hundred different ways to do this with text/data manipulation tools (and line-command, outside of galaxy with unix utilities/scripts), but the tools i used should be a useful start, do not involve complicated regular expressions/programming, and are all included in galaxy with simple usage. thanks!

[/INST] if you do not care about novel transcripts and have a reference genome, go straight to featurecounts and include a known annotation gtf. stringtie would include novel transcripts/genes plus known annotation – but only if the known annotation was included. you can also adjust the settings in stringtie to only output results based known annotation. if you do not include known annotation, only counts based on the regions your read data represent will generated – and that may be where the biggest differences are coming from. so, there are a few different ways to do this and the results would not be expected to be exact between any two de methods/pipelines based on distinct algorithms. using differently created transcript/gene boundaries for the ""annotation"" to determine expression levels is also a factor. extended help for differential expression analysis tools (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/different-expression/) thanks!

[/INST] update the bug report sent in revealed that the bed dataset contained extra spaces. problematic formatting can produce many types of tool errors, but the solution is the same fix the formatting, then rerun tools. tabular datasets (including bed data) can be cleaned-up a few ways. 1. fix the dataset formatting locally on your computer, then upload it to galaxy after. do this if you plan to use the data outside of galaxy as well. or, fix the data in galaxy with one of the methods below and download a copy of the format-corrected bed dataset. 2. remove the extra spaces during upload to galaxy. how-to: in the upload tool, click on the ""gear"" icon and check the box to ""convert spaces to tabs"". the tool merges all consecutive (actual spaces or tabs) into a single ""tab"" – which is what is wanted for proper tabular dataset formatting, including bed data. the screenshot below shows where to find the option. note: if you ever decide to ""paste"" type in) tabular data lines with the upload tool, this is a good option to use to avoid formatting issues. warning: use this option carefully. example: if a dataset has header lines, converting ""whitespace to tabs"" will be applied to those header lines, not just the data lines. that is not always desirable as it can introduce another formatting problem. upload_cleanup_whitespace.png https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/ec68bb47cc8be45475db6d00f8c9a7f6acb3300e.png) 3. run the tool text manipulation convert delimiters to tab on an already loaded dataset. use the settings shown in the screenshot below. once the job completes, the result will have the datatype assigned. click on the pencil icon attributes) for the dataset to change it back to bed, and save. text-manipulation_cleanup_whitespace (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/1x/123365d03a1c8f1c884a7f62fcc5c5b3c5368900.png) faqs: general error help: troubleshooting resources for errors or unexpected results (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/troubleshooting-resources-for-errors-or-unexpected-results/42/5) support links: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/#getting-inputs-right format help for tabular/bed/interval datasets (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/tabular/) common datatypes explained https://galaxyproject.org/learn/datatypes/) the tool i am using does not recognize any input datasets. why? https://galaxyproject.org/support/datatypes-and-tools/) how do i find, adjust, and/or correct metadata? https://galaxyproject.org/support/metadata/) tool error? try sorting your inputs (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/sort-your-inputs/)

[INST] hi, just starting as a galaxy user i got an issue conserning annotation. i have a number of featurecounts output files for de analysis. a number of significantly differentially expressed genes with a fc of 2 were obtained. however, when i want to annotate them using 'annotate deseq2/dexseq output tables' my columns with the annotation info returns only nas. i got the impression that the because of this is that featurecount files come with the entrez-id while this information is not present in my .gtf file that i got from the ensembl repository removed the header lines containing an #). any suggestions how to change the gene entrez-id in my featurecounts output or how to get ens numbers in my .gtf file? thanks for your help, henk [/INST] , you can use the annotatemyids (@link https://usegalaxy.org/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/annotatemyids/annotatemyids/3.7.0+galaxy1) tool in order to perform such format conversion by using the featurecounts file as input. let me know if it works. regards

[INST] hi i am new to galaxy, so if someone has asked this question in the past i apologize. i downloaded 42 files to galaxy via the sra run selector as a collection. i now have my fastq files and would like to use trimmomatic; however, i am above the alloted space quota. trimmomatic was run on the first 15 files already and the rest are waiting to be processed. my question is if i delete/purge the first 15 files in the collection will that allow trimmoatic to resume or will it mess things up because the data is grouped together as a collection. i just not sure and it took forever to download so any advice would be much appreciated. [/INST] one solution is to break out the read data into distinct collections during download and processing in batches. trimmomatic creates near duplicate very large fastq outputs. the idea would be to get through that step with a portion of the data, purge the original files, repeat with another portion, then combine the results into one collection for downstream processing. from your description it seems like 2-4 batches would be enough. another is to make a small short-term extra quota request (extra 100-250 gb for a few days to a week). this is only available for academic researchers at the public sites. how-to for accounts at http://usegalaxy.org. account quotas - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account-quotas/). make the request via email as described in that faq – do not post your information here publicly. for non academics, additional resources require the use of a private galaxy server with resources scaled to fit the work. galaxy platform directory: servers, clouds, and deployable resources - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use) if that is not enough help, would you please post back a share link to this history? that context will help with review and specific solutions. :slight_smile: @link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#sharing-your-history

[INST] hello, please i would like to ask if it is okay and allowed to create another account on galaxy because i used almost all the available space i have in my current account and i am planning to upload more raw data and there is no enough space for that! if not then what do you suggest? thank you in advance! [/INST] at most public galaxy servers, there is a ""one account per user"" quota. in practical terms, this means you can have many galaxy accounts but just one at any particular public galaxy server. for galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org: account terms are explained in this faq: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account/ how to manage data is explained in this faq, including how to download data no longer in active use and how to apply for more quota space short-term for larger projects: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account-quotas/. from your comments, it sounds like you need to download then purge your old work to make room for new work, more help here: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/account-quotas/#reduce-quota-usage-while-still-retaining-prior-work-data-tools-methods creating or using a duplicated account, or someone else's account, to try to get around the account terms will cause problems like this. accounts deleted from galaxy main to enforce posted terms and conditions (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/accounts-deleted-from-galaxy-main-to-enforce-posted-terms-and-conditions/1429) stick to using just one account and you will not have to worry about losing your account or data unexpectedly. the faqs above also cover how to find out the usage terms (and if quota extensions are possible) when working at other public galaxy servers. in short, check the server's home page or directory listing (@link https://galaxyproject.org/use) for that server's contact and quota information, and ask them you have questions. you also have the option of setting up your own galaxy server. a local server can be used to store data context). cloud servers are popular choices for large computational work. if you use one at aws, they offer grants for storage/computational resources (galaxy itself is always free, and the cloudman version is designed to be simple to administrate). these details are also linked from faqs above and at the galaxy resources directory https://galaxyproject.org/use). also, search prior qa with the term here if interested in exploring that option. all public galaxy servers are independently administered and not all follow this forum. if you cannot locate the server contact or quota info for where you are working, share back the url and we can try to help you find it. thanks!

[/INST] , no i do not think there is currently a way around uploading the file to a history of yours at least once. if you need to do this for more than once it may be convenient to maintain a dedicated ""resource"" files history, from which you just drag the dataset over to each analysis history. this way, as explained in galaxy community hub - galaxy community hub (@link https://galaxyproject.org/admin/disk-quotas/), the file will be counted in your storage quota only once. in the long run, this tool should be extended to work also with preinstalled annotation data on the server. i will give this some thought.

[INST] hello everyone. i am trying to operate htseq-count in galaxy. i have used hisat2 bam files (i am using arabidopsis wt and double knock out) and tair10.gff3 annotation file. but every time it shows fatal error after a while. requesting you all to provide your invaluable suggestions. thanking you, mahmudul [/INST] hi, try using the gtf version of the annotation instead. this tool does not accept gff3 formatted annotation. this can get a bit confusing since the tool form states gff as an input, and will accept files with that datatype assigned. this is because many data sources provide gff+gft hybrid data – and the only difference between those two is the last column (attributes). some also release gff3 data that is given a gff datatype (including this source: @link https://www.arabidopsis.org). the gff3 format is structured and labeled much differently than gff or gtf. these data are incredibly difficult to automatically assign a datatype to, because there can be so much variation from sources. custom header lines can interfere, blank lines, etc. it is usually a good idea to check the format yourself once in galaxy to confirm the actual type. sometimes headers need to be removed in gff or gtf datasets before certain tools will consume them properly. this faq explains each, how they are similar/different, and reformatting/transformation tips. common datatypes explained (@link https://galaxyproject.org/learn/datatypes/)

[INST] in stringtie merge, do we merge the replicates of the treatment samples [/INST] in short, the answer is usually ""yes"". the tool can do this always but whether you want to or not depends on your analysis details. usage and which inputs to include (sample gtfs/known gtf) depend on whether you are going to perform the de analysis on only known transcripts/genes, or on only discovered transcripts/genes, or on both. stingtie merge can be used to do the following: pre-process an existing reference annotation gtf dataset, by itself, so it can be used with stringtie to guide assembly, and with other downstream tools. not all public gtfs are formatted in a way other tools can interpret and this tool can be used to ""groom"" a gtf. combine the per-sample gtf results of stingtie, and optionally the reference gtf into a unified gtf assembly that can be used with downstream differential expression tools. more details that summarize the different use-cases are in this prior galaxy biostars qa post: question: stringtie and stringtie merge - when to apply the guide gff (reference annotation file)?

[INST] hello, i am new to exome sequencing analysis. i have been looking into the theory and tried using galaxy for the same. i got 2 mutations following a published pipeline from the shared data (which uses freebayes) but only one of them was confirmed by sanger sequencing. looking back at my snp-sift output, i see that although the unconfirmed variant is of good quality is good], the cigar string for that variant is just represented as ""cigar=1x"". from a theoretical point of view, what i could understand is that, cigar strings is generally represented as some matches, then some mismatches/insertion/deletion and then some matches. so, i am unable to understand how it can just be ""cigar=1x"". if it is possible, please tell what does it say about the quality of that variant. any help would be appreciated. roy [/INST] hi, if the variant in question is a single nucleotide change, then cigar=1x is just fine though also totally meaningless. cigar strings in the vcf info field (because that is what i think we are talking about here) describe how to align an alternate allele to the reference allele. if your ref and your alt allele both have a length of 1 nt, then the only possibility to align the two is with one mismatch, which is exactly what 1x means. what you might confuse this with is the cigar string associated with aligned reads in a bam file. this version describes how to align the read to the reference sequence and that is what would probably be more relevant for assessing the quality of the variant call. however, it is typically easier to look at reads aligned to the reference in a genome browser (like igv) than to do it manually by inspecting cigar strings one by one.

[INST] hi - looking for any advice or solution. i am running some workflows and an unable to complete them because a step crashes giving the ""cannot allocate memory"" error. however, it randomly occurs during different steps in the workflow. none of my steps are very demanding, they are simple things like sort or join two datasets, although i am doing a blast search on a transcriptome that i uploaded. is there a memory cache i need to purge somewhere? i have purged deleted files and am nowhere near by disk quota. thanks for any help, i am stuck. [/INST] welcome, @user! the memory used to execute jobs is different from the memory used to store account data. how you describe the problem has in the past indicated that the jobs are approaching the memory limit of what the public server can process. in short, sometimes the jobs hit a cluster node that can execute successfully and sometimes not. sorting data can require quite a bit of memory, depending on the datatype and size of the dataset. there are a few different ""sort"" tools, so i cannot offer many more details without knowing which you are using. that said, a highly fragmented transcriptome can easily exceed resources (bam or tabular results). filtering out smaller target sequences can often help, especially if they are too small to capture meaningful hits anyway. modifying the hit parameters can also help (more stringent criteria). in a bam result, the header can get very large (includes each target), causing a sort bam type of job to fail at the indexing or sorting steps. often tabular output is a better choice. only are retained, that can be later filtered to reduce redundancy, before doing further manipulations that compare the data to other data (join functions). tools to filter might include: select, filter, sed, awk, etc. blast can create a great deal of overlapping"", and ""low specificity"" hits. sometimes running with strict parameters first, then remapping whatever did not map originally, at a lower stringency threshold, is a good strategy to avoid generating too much output (often these are uninformative sub-hits). join two datasets can also be memory intensive, both with processing and with handling the output. it is possible to create pathologically large outputs where each row of the first dataset matches with each row of the second. we do recommend inputting the larger of the two datasets second on the tool form to maximize how the tool uses resources. you might need to modify your query to restrict the output/be more specific or split up the larger dataset into chunks first (tools might include: line/word/character count, select first/last lines, remove beginning of a file), then run the join in distinct jobs, and at the end combine the results (tool: concatenate). if it turns out that you need your jobs processed as-is, and they are exceeding resources on the public galaxy main server at https://usegalaxy.org any usegalaxy.* server), the option to move to your own cloud, docker or local galaxy is available. enough job processing memory resources would need to be allocated, and that is usually easier with a cloud solution for a few reasons (less administrative setup, custom high-memory cluster choices). keep in mind that galaxy itself is always free, but commercial cloud services are not (although aws does offer grants for education/research). you could also check to see if your affiliations include access to academic cloud resources. if interested, please see: https://galaxyproject.org/choices/ https://galaxyproject.org/use/ faqs: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/#troubleshooting my job ended with an error. what can i do? https://galaxyproject.org/support/tool-error/) start here since it does not sound like data format problems are a factor: @link https://galaxyproject.org/support/tool-error/#type-exceeds-memory-allocation hope that helps!

[INST] hello everyone, i already used lefse in (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/d/d31327085d8bd9ea8df994000540220c8b3c4d99.jpeg) [/INST] @quote i already used lefse in 2018 and have now a new dataset to analyse. i noticed when i upload my .tsv file that it looks different when i view the data with the ""view data"" function pictures attached). in 2018 the table had a grey bar with numbers at the top and it looked like a proper table. now my data looks like a text file. i was wondering if something is wrong with my file, although lefse does not complain. the first screenshot is what would be expected for a dataset with the datatype ""tabular"" or ""tsv"" assigned. the second screenshot is what would be expected for a dataset with the datatype ""txt"" assigned. it is the default view for any plain text file plus others). a very large dataset of many datatypes will revert back to the view shown in the second screenshot (""large"" can differ by galaxy server). that seems to be what is happening – the files are different sizes but both have the datatype assigned? meaning, dataset 47 has fewer lines than dataset 56 (?). that would explain the difference in the ""view data"" display. this really is ""display"" only and does not change the actual contents of the file/dataset. if you look at the expanded dataset 56 ""peek"" view' in the history panel, you can see that it was small enough to display as ""tabular with the column numbers"" since only the first 5 lines are used for that function practical/design reasons). note: a compressed dataset various types) might display as plain text (second screenshot) as well. this is not your situation but seemed worth clarifying for you (other display use-cases) or for anyone else reading this qa my further analysis says there are no significant discriminative features in my 133 samples. i am not sure if i can trust the results now. any help and/or advice is appreciated! how data displays differently (by datatype or size) is part of the larger application settings. that is unrelated to how tools function/execute or would not lead to any downstream differences analysis results – the dataset's content/data itself is not modified, and that is what tools use as inputs. you are working at this public server, correct? galaxy (@link https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) the server is set up a bit differently than other public servers and hosts custom versions of tools, in particular the lefse tool suite. their support/admin team does not follow this forum, but there are other ways to contact them about odd or non-reproducible results. i do not think that is what your issue is (unless those results are not reproducible, maybe run the analysis again and compare?). but if you have tool concerns or odd results with a rerun comparison, you could contact the huttenhower support/admin team for more help, especially if you think there is a technical problem unrelated to the display differences. please see this prior qa for how: welcome@systemyour header line does not match those in the examples. scroll down on the form to the help section for the details, including linked example inputs. thehttps://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/public galaxy server hosts customized versions of the lefse tools. if you need more help than a tool form provides, contact the server support team directly. this particular server's support/admin team do not track this forum as far as i know. contact information for public galaxy thanks!

[/INST] the http://usegalaxy.eu server was undergoing server changes over the last few days. from my experiences during that time frame, the service was either completely inaccessible (with a fall-over landing page stating the service is not available), or i could reach the server and some functions were ok and others were slower or stalled (upload – both by local file and by url, loading up tool forms – but other functions could also present as odd) . @link http://usegalaxy.eu now has a banner up on the server with an explanation. 17.05.2022. since this morning, we are experiencing issues on our main storage. the service is, currently, not reliable. we are working on a solution if you notice odd behavior again sometime in the future: a server restart might cause odd behavior for a minute or two. refreshing your browser window and starting the problematic action over again is usually enough. check the overall status for any of the usegalaxy.* servers and related primary resources, at the publicly posted status page here: @link https://status.galaxyproject.org/ ask questions at this forum if both of those do not help, or apply, or if you need more details. while waiting for a reply, you can work at any of the other usegalaxy.* servers. one account at each has benefits: different storage/computational server resources plus your account at each has distinct resources (data storage quota). note: i am going to modify the topic title and put this as the solution to make it easier for other people to find your question and the advice in the reply, should they run into a problem at the eu server and are not sure what is going on. thanks for posting!

[INST] dear sir, . is it ok??? or did i out something wrong [/INST] if the job is running (yellow/peach dataset), it is usually best to allow it to run. the same is true for queued jobs (grey dataset). this applies to jobs (any tool) executed at a public galaxy server. 20 gb of fastq data – uncompressed creates a very large assembly job. if it fails later on for exceeding resources (red dataset), you will need to do one or more of these: try a rerun to eliminate cluster issues more qa/qc on the input reads (always recommended) consider downsampling the reads (tool: seqtk) possibly need to move to your own galaxy server where more resources can be allocated. the gvl version of cloudman is one option: @link https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog i added some tags to your post that will find prior qa about the above actions. or, you can search the forum with those keywords (not all posts get tagged). you did not state where you are working. but, if by chance at galaxy main @link https://usegalaxy.org, i can let you know that the cluster that runs trinity unicycler rna-star) is very busy. longer queue times are expected. if you delete the current job and rerun, that will only place your job back at the end of the queue again, extending wait time. thanks!

[INST] hello, there all while i am new to galaxy, i have a basic query after uploading my datasets, i joined the paired end data by using fastq-join, with each read about 4.8 gb in size it produced three different files as 1 fastq-join on data 27(unmatched 2) (size 4.6 gb) 2. fastq-join on data 27 (unmatched 1) size 4.6gb 3. fastq-join on data 27 (joined) size 210.4 mb now my question is which file i have to choose for further downstream analysis. thanks in advances any possible help will.be highly appriciated [/INST] why in particular are you using fastq-join? this joins reads only when they are overlapping, and most fastq reads will not overlap. from the size of your outputs it certainly looks like you have non-overlapping reads. depending on what you are trying to achieve, you will either use the two read datasets (which here are largely preserved in the ""unmatched 1"" and ""unmatched 2"" datasets or you will use the joined one (but this seems very small in your example). if you explain a bit more about the analysis you are trying to do it will help people advise better.

[INST] hello, i am trying to generate multiqc report from multiple qualimap rna-seq qc files. i am using '@link http://usegalaxy.org'. the multiqc runs but does not give any output bytes). i think the problem is because multiqc is expecting genome_coverage to be the first file in the qualimap rna-seq qc output. however, i do not see any such report. genome_coverage is present in the qualimap report, but not in the raw data folder. i am not sure why this is happening. versions: multiqc v1.8 qualimap rna-seq qc v2.2.2d p.s. multiqc works fine with star output and fastqc raw data. [/INST] hi, try using the tool qualimap counts qc instead to generate a summary. that means you will want to output the optional output, not just ""statistics"", when running qualimap rna-seq qc. the version of multiqc wrapped in galaxy does not interpret qualimap rna-seq qc reports (raw data). it expects qualimap bamqc data) input, only, despite the top menu label stating that the input could be from either tool. the lower menu does specify bamqc but we can see how that can be confusing. the tool wrapper could probably be updated to be clearer we will follow up on that for later potential changes. appreciate your patience for a reply!

[INST] hi everyone, i have a tabular file as output of my tool and i would like to use the first row as header (displayed in blue in the view tab). i read an old discussion where they suggested to use the '#' on the first row to let galaxy knowing that this is the header row but it seems that it is not working since the header is still considered part of the data. thank you for the help [/INST] @quote i read an old discussion where they suggested to use the '#' on the first row to let galaxy knowing that this is the header row that is correct. in the ""peek view"", it will look like this for a tabular datatype with one header row starting with a #. tabular-header-peek-view (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/a/a4bea8ae4ad2062745ec258e2b1c29d001ed28cc.png) how to interpret: columns are numbered with a dark blue background. technically, and the header is counted up as a header line, other lines are counted as data lines. tabular is one of the most general datatypes. the header line and data lines are passed to downstream tools. some tools will have an option on the form where you can specify the input has a header line, or how many rows to consider as a header line. other tools will not, and for these, the user would need to strip header lines out first. there are other defined datatypes that have ""built in"" headers. example: bed. what is seen in the ""peek view"" for that datatype, under the dark blue background, is defined in the bed datatype specification (built into galaxy), and not included in the file contents. if you know what tools are likely to consume the output of your tool, you can test out how those interpret your header. why? several of the tools under manipulation"" expect no header lines in any data. if you want people to be able to use those tools without extra formatting steps, consider not including a header or making it an optional output on your tool's form. maybe put some examples in your tool's help section to alert users about how to use the output with example tools that interpret it differently.

[INST] hi! i have 12 samples in total - 2 genotypes, and 4 treatments, 3 replicates each. after running deseq2, i see with the pca plots that there is a strong batch effect - the samples from one genotype aggregate according to the batch of cells and not the treatments. i am trying to use ruvseq in http://usegalaxy.org but i am not sure how. as factors, should i input genotype, treatment and the batches as well? thank you!!! best, carolina [/INST] , these kind of known or easily inferred batch effects can be accommodated by deseq2 without using ruvseq. you can add multiple factors (not factor levels) in the deseq2 wrapper by clicking on insert factor. the first factor is the primary factor, so should probably be treatment. you can then add a genotypes and batch information as secondary and tertiary factors. if you want to use ruvseq in galaxy you would only use the primary factor levels and let the algorithm find the batch factors that you can then use in deseq2. hope that helps, marius

(@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/) note: galaxy does not modify the original underlying tool. tools are instead in a way that makes it easier to use them all together all in one place: to build a workflow or to share exact methods/data with others. or if you just prefer using a gui :slight_smile:. the usage is (mostly) otherwise the same as the command-line. related: if you can find the fasta for other protein database sources, those can be included with prokka using this option: optional fasta file of trusted proteins to first annotate from hope that helps!

[INST] hello, i am new to galaxy and currently doing galaxy 101 tutorial. when trying to get the data from ucsc main table browser and after sending the output to galaxy, it does not send to the current open session/history. it logs me out and create a new history. thanks trupti [/INST] there was a prior issue that logged you out of galaxy when downloading data from the ucsc table browser. it was not a consistent fail and we believe it was related to query-quotas at ucsc, or session identifiers in galaxy (how ucsc knows where to download the data). logging into galaxy will add the newly downloaded data into a new history in your account, and you will need to consolidate datasets between histories. copies of datasets in your own account do not consume extra quota space, but you can still purge the histories you do not need once you have a copy of the data in the history you want to work in. inconvenient, but we do not have another solution right now. this is the open ticket: redirect from data sources sometimes loses session cookies · issue galaxyproject/galaxy github (@link https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/11374)

[INST] hello, i am new to galaxy, and especially new to using cloud resources. i set up a cloud instance of galaxy, but am 100% completely lost. there are a few thing things that do not really seem to be adding up. i am very sorry for, what are probably trivial questions, but i would appreciate some help, so in the cloudlaunch appliances"" page, it says i am running a genomics virtual lab on the aws cloud. when i click on the access link, it takes me to the gvl dashboard where it says that galaxy is not running, but cloudman is. so i click on the cloudman access link, and it tells me that i am running out of disk space. now, i managed to get galaxy working a few weeks ago (not sure how), and managed to download a fastq file that was probably about 6 gb. but the cloudman console was telling me that i was running out of space. i deleted the file, and then the history pane on galaxy showed that my history was taking up 12 gb of storage, but hte number on the top right of the console said i was using about 6.8 gb. then, under cluster status in the cloudman console, it says i have used 54 gb / 54 gb, but in the admin console, under file systems, it is telling me that the different fiel systems are taking up almost 150 gb of storage. so i am having trouble making sense of all this information. all i did was download a 6 gb file, which i then deleted. so why am i getting all this mixed information? i am sorry for the mess of information, but i would greatly appreciate it if someone could point towards something that could help me understand what is going on. how do i make sense of the memory usage? also, i tried restarting galaxy from the cloudman admin console, but it seems to be taking a long time. is this normal? [/INST] sorry to hear about the storage troubles. hopefully together we can figure out what exactly is going on. so, by default, galaxy does not really delete files from disk when a file is deleted from a history. it just marks a dataset as deleted in case you change your mind about wanting to un-delete later. to actually remove a dataset from disk, it is necessary to purge it, which is available under the history settings cog by clicking purge deleted datasets. a more system-level approach would be to ssh to your instance and run the cleanup scripts, as described here: @link https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/performance/purge-histories-and-datasets/ overall, the reason the cloudman console is showing more disk usage than what you have uploaded to galaxy is because of galaxy and other supporting/accompanying software that is running on the same disk. finally, if all you have done is uploaded a single file to your instance and realized the disk is too small, i would recommend you just delete that particular instance and launch a brand new one with a larger disk. things will just go a lot quicker and smoother than fighting with the storage and/or waiting for a disk resize (which can take many, many hours to complete in the case of amazon).

[INST] hi there, i am trying to obtain a consensus sequence from sequences that i have already aligned. what has been done so far is that i have uploaded multiple data obtained from pcr on galaxy. i then used bowtie 2 to map reads against a reference genome (obtained from genbank). i then ran ivar consensus on each of the bowtie outputs to get the consensus and aligned them on mega11. how do i get a single consensus from the aligned data? i tried to repeat the whole process by reuploading the aligned dataset onto galaxy and running bowtie 2 and ivar consensus again but this gave me a sequence with alot of ns. the aligned data set i had consists of about 30 sequences and they all aligned very well on mega11. does anyone know what i am doing wrong/what i can do to circumvent this? thanks! [/INST] i believe mega can create a consensus sequence for an alignment. , igor

[INST] greetings! i am a long-time circos user through the command line, and i would like to be able to utilize circos within galaxy. however, i have been unable to get circos to work on @link http://usegalaxy.org, for any job regardless of how basic. notably, one of the test files i have been using to create a basic ideogram (hg18_karyotype_withbands.txt) is taken directly from the gtn tutorial for circos, so this input file has already been vetted in terms of proper formatting. i have also been testing with another custom karyotype file (karyotype.human.hg38.txt) with the same results. the ""view or report error"" button does not provide any additional information for these failed jobs, and does not allow me to submit a bug report for some reason. notably, running the same exact jobs on @link http://usegalaxy.eu is successful! i tested both on ""circos visualizes data in a circular layout version 0.69.8+galaxy8)"" (which is not available on @link http://usegalaxy.org) and circos visualizes data in a circular layout version 0.69.8+galaxy7) (which is the newest version found on http://usegalaxy.org) - and in both cases for both test files, it works as intended. links to both test histories: @link http://usegalaxy.org history link: galaxy | accessible history circos test history (@link https://usegalaxy.org/you/rerdmann/h/circos-test-history) @link http://usegalaxy.eu history link: galaxy europe | accessible history circos test history https://usegalaxy.eu/you/robert.m.erdmann/h/circos-test-history-europe) (it appears this note is in the same spirit as problems with circos (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/problems-with-circos/4988), but in this case, i am using version 7…) thanks for taking a look. [/INST] thanks for reporting the problem! we were internally tracking the need to update the tool suite but i just make a public tracking ticket (@link https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook/issues/346) for that as well. until it closes or you see the updated version on the http://usegalaxy.org server, please run the tool at http://usegalaxy.eu instead.

[INST] hi would it be possible to add this genome? also if i want to align using hisat2 and use a file added to my local history in the meantime, can i just use a fasta file or do i need to generate the files? thanks [/INST] d'artagnan, it would be possible to add that genome to hisat2's indexes, but in the meantime, you can get away with uploading the reference genome and using that as another input by selecting the use a genome from history option. the tool will then generate its own .ht2 files for that analysis, so you would not need to do anything in addition.

[/INST] maybe follow any published protocol/workflow. if you are after read counts in exons, maybe look at dexseq tools or use tools like featurecounts without aggregation of counts. to get sequences have a look at interval tools, such as bedtools. you also can get positions of introns using bedtools, if you have 12 columns bed files. , igor

[INST] is there any path in galaxy to convert tab file to bam ? [/INST] could you explain more about what you are doing? share a few sample lines? the tabular datatype is very general. one example: if the tabular dataset contained identifiers and sequence reads: convert tabular fasta fastq. actual quality scores are optional default scores can be added in. convert fastq to an unmapped bam/sam not very useful and an extra step since most tools accept reads in fastq format as an input, even if they also accept reads in an unmapped bam/sam.

to be running out of resources when attempting to sorting out usable read pairs from those that are not. pre-filtering by length will address that. use a qa tool that will remove/separate both ends of a pair if one of the paired reads fails the filter. trinity expects intact pairs as an input. if it seems like that length filter eliminates too many reads: prior qa steps may have been too strict you need to still run qa the reads were originally too short the read quality is actually low, and the qa steps are correct the last two would be the most concerning re is this data even usable?

[INST] . i tried to use the same fasta.gz and gtf uncompressed file directly and run without any problem. there is any chance set the option gtf/gff file to be used as an uncompressed file automatically? have a nice day! [/INST] @quote i use star very often and i noticed that the fasta.gz genome file was used as uncompressed file, but the gtf.gz file was not used as a uncompressed file resulting in a error.i tried to use the same fasta.gz and gtf uncompressed file directly and run without any problem.there is any chance set the option gtf/gff file to be used as an uncompressed file automatically? data that is in gtf.gz format is automatically uncompressed to gtf during upload. there is no datatype for gtf.gz so it would not be possible to have a dataset with gtf.gz assigned as the datatype. this means there is nothing to implicitly convert compressed to uncompressed at runtime. if you are not working at a usegalaxy.* server, maybe test out the upload of the data at one of those to better understand the default/supported behavior? allow galaxy to autodetect the datatype. other galaxy servers, public or private, may have different custom datatype configurations added, or be running a (much) older galaxy release, or be running a customized version of this tool. those admins/tool developers would be the best people to contact if you want a change that fits the custom server environment you are working in. https://galaxyproject.org/use/ thanks!

[/INST] @quote can i select mm10 during hisat2 and in the next stingtie i use the earlier version mm39 which i uploaded you will have technical and scientific problems if data based on different genome assemblies are used together in the same analysis. choose a matching reference genome and reference annotation at the start of an analysis and use those throughout. public servers host different genome indexes. http://usegalaxy.eu hosts mm39 for now. note: next time, please consider asking a new question for new problems. you can reference other topics by url for context.

[/INST] update i took a look at one of your queued jobs (blastp) – there are input problems that will cause the job to fail once it does run. you should fix these, then rerun. incorrect datatype both datasets are in fasta format, but one is labeled as fastq. faq (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#changing-the-datatype) both fasta datasets includes description content on the title line. this will not always lead to errors at the mapping step, but definitely can with many downstream tools. standardizing the format at the start of an analysis is usually best. faq (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#working-with-very-large-fasta-datasets) in one of your other histories, there is a queued busco job that also has an input that is in fasta format but is labeled with a fastq datatype. fix that as well, then rerun. that same history has another fasta dataset that is uncompressed and with what appears to be the correct datatype assigned. however, it seems odd that some data is uncompressed and some is compressed for similar jobs. you should confirm if any of your data is actually compressed or not, and assign the correct datatype. running qa tools can help catch format problems, example: fastqc. galaxy will guess the datatype when data is uploaded, or you can use the redetect function after upload/manipulations, but this tends to work best with uncompressed data for most data formats (bam is one exception). how to check for input problems (before a job is run, or after once it fails): faq https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/#understanding-input-error-messages) hope that helps! the job queue for some tools has been very busy over the last few days at the http://usegalaxy.org public galaxy server. this includes mapping and other computationally intensive tools. the best strategy is to leave queued jobs queued. avoid deleting and rerunning, as all new jobs are placed back at the end of the queue extending the wait time.

[INST] hey there… i have a bacterial genome ngs reads please help me to assemble these reads for further process [/INST] good day waqas. i recommend using torsten seeman's shovill tool - this is a wrapper around spades and does a very good job with most microbial genomes. also note that the microbinfie podcast discusses microbial genome assembly in episodes 19 (@link https://soundcloud.com/microbinfie/microbinfies-assemble), https://soundcloud.com/microbinfie/20-assembly-read-healing and @link https://soundcloud.com/microbinfie/22-assembly-after-party. all of these are worth a listen. finally there are some tutorials on the galaxy training portal on assembly (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/) (although i would not use velvet as used in their examples, shovill is much better) and annotation (@link https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/) with e.g. prokka.

[/INST] hey @user! it is definitely possible, although fyi by default galaxy within the gvl uses the kubernetes job runner rather than slurm (although hybrid setups, running on k8s but dispatching to slurm is definitely possible). running the gvl locally will need some tinkering to the out-of-the box configuration which is intended for the cloud, but in theory the biggest blocker is just figuring out a proper storageclass for the kubernetes cluster. traditionally for a local setup we have used hostpath storageclass which just uses the local host storage. i have not set it up locally in a few months, but can try it again soon and maybe add a bit of documentation for future cases. if you have a lot of experience in this realm, you can likely figure it out on your own. the entry point for the boot mechanism is the @link https://github.com/cloudve/cloudman-boot docker image which sets up rancher and installs the base gvl infrastructure (cloudman). if you are just starting with k8s, it might be a bit harder to find the right configuration on your own, but we could schedule a time to do an interactive session over zoom to help you get started. feel free to email at almahmoud@jhu.edu to set-up a time in the next few weeks, or send me a message on gitter/slack (@system) and i will be happy to help however i can and get other people involved to help as well.

[INST] i have tried uploading several datafiles, but for some reason they cannot be detected as the bam datatype (and therefore not used in my workflow). i have tried manually setting the datatype to bam both before and after uploading the files. but it gives me the error 'an error occurred setting the metadata for this dataset. set it manually or retry auto-detection'. both of these options gave a similar error. the datasets look like the image. i have uploaded .bam files before and it was never an issue. the only difference is that these bamfiles were generated from files. i am quite novel to working with these datatypes, so hope i have given all the information needed to help me with this issue. how can i make sure they are detected as proper bamfiles? thanks a lot for the help! image (@link https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/galaxy/original/2x/0/00cf2bc319781fce0ad718acafbf5db41925c97e.png) [/INST] @quote i have uploaded .bam files before and it was never an issue. the only difference is that these bamfiles were generated from files. try this: check the file content before upload to galaxy. try converting bam to sam format with samtools. you could also try sorting the bam. if it fails for you locally, then it would fail in galaxy. or, try this: directly upload the cram data to galaxy. most tools do not directly use cram format, but you can convert cram to bam in galaxy with the tool samtools view. for either, try letting the upload tool auto detect the format first. if that does not work, you can assign the datatype instead (during upload not sure if you tried that already for the bam or not). i am also not exactly sure how good we are at auto detecting cram format right now… but i will test that later today or tomorrow since am now curious. if any usage deviates from the above i will post back. it would be best to do this at the http://usegalaxy.org or @link http://usegalaxy.org.au server right now. the http://usegalaxy.eu server is undergoing some admin changes (@link https://help.galaxyproject.org/t/usegalaxy-eu-unexpected-server-behavior-may-2022/8062) this week, and some odd behavior is expected until the banner clears. it is easier to troubleshoot without complicating factors. thanks!

[INST] how often do i have to update galaxy in a productive environment (just 2-3 users) in order to keep up with new tools? does updating galaxy break a lot of dependencies for installed tools in general? are there some kind of minor and mojor releases? is this documented anywhere? [/INST] updating galaxy does not usually break tools. the tool wrapper description does not really change much. i think galaxy 16.01 was the last major change for galaxy tool compatibility. branches in the repo titled 'release_xxx' are the best way to keep up with the releases rather than using the zipped releases as they contain important bug fixes. galaxy unfortunately does not maintain semver patch versions, you have to use the commit hash for the branch.

[INST] dear galaxy community, i need to add exac_nfe info in vcf. i am thinking about useing ""snpsift annotate"" to annotate the snp id with exac_nfe as info. however, i could not find a way to download the exac03(hg19) file and import it to galaxy. already to find information from annovar, ucsc, and exac browser, but could not find a way to get the file.) can anyone help me with that? or maybe i am wrong, it is not the way to add exac_nfe information. thanks a lot susan [/INST] hi susan, the simplest way to bring in these annotations would be via the gemini toolsuite, just that a) you will have to stop working with vcf format at that point because gemini converts vcf to an sqlite database during the annotation step and keeps using this format for all further processing and querying b) with the current version of gemini, you will only have exac release 0.3 available c) you would have to work on @link http://usegalaxy.eu for now because gemini, for technical reasons, is currently not available on @link http://usegalxy.org hopefully this will get fixed in the not so distant future) if you want to try to annotate your vcf directly (snpsift annotate may or may not work for the task - i never tried to use it for anything but dbsnp data) the data you are looking for is available from: @link ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/exac_release the files you find there have been compressed with bgzip, but if you specify data type ""vcf"" on import galaxy should unpack them for you.

[INST] hello, i am using the main galaxy server at https://usegalaxy.org/ i have a collection of paired-end rna-seq data with 30 pairs in it. with just this collection and a few other files, my storage usage sits at 5% (although, i suspect this may be incorrect given the size of the collection?). when i try to run cutadapt on this dataset, the storage usage begins to move up, far past what i would expect it to given that it can only be making the files smaller. after only a few pairs are completed, i start getting a ""no space left on device"" error. even stranger, one pair will fail to run due to this error, but the next 10 will complete successfully. then a couple more will fail due to the same error. when i let it run completely, it finishes at about 80% storage used. when run multiple times, different pairs fail each time. i know something must be going on, but i cannot figure it out. earlier today i had the entire collection run through cutadapt successfully, but i purged it because it was not working with downstream software. finally, i wanted to mention that running the data as ""multiple datasets"" rather than ""dataset collection"" seems to function as intended. however, i lose the organization of the collection in this case, so i would like to be able to run it as it stands now. any input is appreciated!

[INST] i have used the repeatexplorer2 tool to analyze paired-end sequencing data made from a genomic dna library of a human cell line. the tool appears to have worked successfully and finds many satellite clusters but for rdna it says ""not found"". what needs to be done differently here to analyze the rdna? or is it likely among the category and just not recognized as rdna? thanks. [/INST] first of all it looks like repeatexplorer is a fairly specific pipeline with its own galaxy server and user registration. on the website @link https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/ i see the following text: if you need help with repeatexplorer or you want to report a problem and our wiki is not able to give you answers, please contact server administrator (@link mailto:regalaxy@rt.cesnet.cz). i think the server administrator can give you a better answer. if you ask your question to the server administrator you may need to clarify what you mean with rdna and if ""not found"" is an error or an output message. i do not know the tool but i would guess that you get more output then just ""not found"" (i can be wrong ofcourse). do you mean recombinant dna? and are it just fastq or fasta files? in addition to that if you do mean recombinant dna i would guess it is very possible to not find satelites because mostly satelites are non-coding and recombinant dna (created in a lab) is only coding. i hope for now my reply is helpfull and maybe someone with experience with this tool will also see your post.

[INST] what is the difference between the p-value and the p-adj columns in the deseq2 data table? which of these columns is more important for assessing significant differences in gene expression? [/INST] , as probably you know, the p-value is a measure of how likely you are to get a specific gene if no real difference exists. a p-value threshold of 0.05 states that there is a 5% chance that the result is a false positive (considered differentially expressed when is not). while 5% is acceptable for one test, if we do a lot of tests on the data, then this 5% can result in a large number of false positives (e.g. a differential expression analysis of 8.000 expressed genes would include 8.000 * 0.05 = 400 false positives!) an adjusted p-value aims to overcome the problems due to multiple testing by reducing the p-value threshold from the common 0.05 to a more reasonable value. then, depending on how strict you want the analysis to be, you should choose one or the other value. regards
