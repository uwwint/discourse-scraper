    "# \"Hello @Sachin_Srivastava\\nIf the job is running (yellow/peach dataset), it is usually best to allow it to run. The same is true for queued jobs (grey dataset). This applies to jobs (any tool) executed at a public Galaxy server.\\n20 GB of fastq data – uncompressed – creates a very large assembly job. If it fails later on for exceeding resources (red dataset), you’ll need to do one or more of these:\\n\\nTry a rerun to eliminate cluster issues\\nMore QA/QC on the input reads (always recommended)\\nConsider downsampling the reads (tool: Seqtk)\\nPossibly need to move to your own Galaxy server where more resources can be allocated. The GVL version of Cloudman is one option: https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog\\n\\n\\nI added some tags to your post that will find prior Q&A about the above actions. Or, you can search the forum with those keywords (not all posts get tagged).\\nYou didn’t state where you are working. But, if by chance at Galaxy Main https://usegalaxy.org, I can let you know that the cluster that runs Trinity (and Unicycler + RNA-Star) is very busy. Longer queue times are expected. If you delete the current job and rerun, that will only place your job back at the end of the queue again, extending wait time.\\nThanks!\"]\n",
